Gratitude is expressed to the Board members, the entire team, and erstwhile HDFC Limited for accomplishing the complex merger seamlessly, efficiently, and effectively, with support from various regulatory bodies. The merger has strengthened the bank's position as a leading financial conglomerate, now the custodian of the HDFC brand.\n\nThe Indian economy and the bank have shown resilience amidst global headwinds. Sound policies and timely interventions by the RBI have prepared the bank for monetary tightening. The GDP in India grew at 8.2 percent while global GDP growth was 3.2 percent in 2023. India remains the fastest-growing major economy, with GDP projected at 7.2 percent, supported by increased capital expenditure in infrastructure development. Capex growth stood at 11.0 percent between FY22 and FY24, with private sector investment showing resurgence in sectors like cement, steel, and oil and gas. Growth has also benefited from manufacturing and construction activity, lower input costs, and government support to MSMEs through schemes like ECLGS and PLI. Despite strong macroeconomic fundamentals, slowdown in household savings has strained liquidity. The bank has capitalized on growth opportunities by funding SMEs and retail consumers while managing liquidity constraints.\n\nThe integration of the merger is completed seamlessly across all dimensions of business and customer services, and robust risk management and compliance functions are in place.

The Indian economy grew by 8.2 percent in FY24, the highest among major economies, supported by infrastructure development, moderating inflation, manufacturing performance, and consumer demand. Credit growth has been in double digits since April 2022 fueled by demand for consumer durables and retail spends, with retail loans outpacing nominal GDP growth. The RBI anticipates India’s GDP growth at 7.2 percent in FY25, supported by private capital expenditure, government spending, consumer spending, government reforms like PLI schemes, and diversification of supply chains.\n\nThe merger, effective on July 1, 2023, marks a new phase for the bank, HDFC Bank 2.0, with a different balance sheet composition. India's unprecedented urbanization, driven by rising incomes, presents a massive opportunity. The real estate sector is expected to reach US$1 trillion by 2030, contributing 13 percent to the country’s GDP by 2025. The merger has opened growth avenues through the mortgage business with cross-selling opportunities. The bank has shown consistent double-digit growth in its home loan business, with a sequential growth of 4 percent.

      "summary": "The organization's materiality assessment process for FY23 involved several steps, starting with a review of 16 sustainability topics which had been identified through stakeholder engagements, data analysis, regulatory compliance, and industry benchmarking. Stakeholder survey responses were consolidated to derive priorities for respective stakeholder groups, and then weighted prioritization was conducted across different aspects by assigning weights to each group. This allowed for the prioritization of topics as \"Most important\", \"Important\" and \"Less important\" by considering the reach of impacts within the value chain, the magnitude of the impact, and the likelihood of occurrence. Subsequently, a thorough analysis was conducted to assess the economic, environmental, and social impacts, both positive and negative, associated with each topic, which was then superimposed with impact scores derived from previous stakeholder consultations across financial and impact materiality dimensions. This revaluation resulted in the consolidation of some topics, leading to a final list of 14 material topics relevant to the Bank. These 14 sustainability issues and their multi-faceted impact assessments were then ranked in a materiality matrix. Further, the identified material topics were mapped against risk categories within the risk management framework, with nine topics identified as areas with opportunity and five having the potential to pose a risk to the business.

      "summary": "Over the past three years, the Indian economy has demonstrated strong growth, averaging 8.3 percent. Provisional estimates from the National Statistical Office (NSO) indicate a real GDP growth of 8.2 percent for FY24, driven by increased capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure development like roads, highways, railways, and housing, primarily through government initiatives. Private sector investment has also shown signs of revival in sectors such as cement, steel, and oil and gas. In contrast, private consumption growth slowed to 4.0 percent in FY24, down from 6.8 percent in FY23 and 11.7 percent in FY22, as pent-up demand waned and interest rates rose. High food inflation and an inconsistent monsoon season further impacted rural demand recovery.\n\nThe supply side benefited from increased manufacturing and construction activity. The manufacturing sector saw improved profit margins due to lower input costs, supported by government schemes like the ECLGS for MSMEs. Furthermore, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) and FAME 2 Schemes promoted growth in critical sectors such as automobiles, electronics (especially mobile handsets), and metals. The construction sector has maintained an average growth rate of 13.1 percent over the past three years, supported by government infrastructure investments and increasing housing market demand. The slowdown in global growth impacted India's exports of goods and services in FY24. Diversification into new markets, such as Central Asia and Latin America, and the expansion of professional and business services exports helped mitigate this impact.\n\nLooking ahead, India is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing economies, with the RBI forecasting a GDP growth rate of 7.2 percent for FY25. Economic activity is projected to be supported by increased private capital expenditure and continued government capital spending. A higher allocation for PLI sectors in the FY25 budget is expected to boost manufacturing activity and attract FDI flows. Continued supply chain diversification from China to other emerging markets is also likely to channel investment into India. The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its global growth forecast by 10 bps to 3.2 percent for FY24, which bodes well for India's economic growth. Domestic consumer spending is expected to recover, particularly in rural areas, due to a normal monsoon, stable inflation, and reduced interest rates.\n\nInflationary pressures have moderated, with retail inflation averaging 5.4 percent in FY24, down from 6.7 percent in FY23. Despite a peak of 7.4 percent in July 2023, retail inflation has since moderated, reaching 4.83 percent in April 2024. Core inflation has also fallen below 4 percent, signaling a disinflationary trend. Retail inflation is projected to average 4.6 percent in FY25, assuming a normal monsoon, supported by a favorable economic base and controlled core inflation. However, weather-related events like heatwaves and uneven monsoons, along with a resurgence in global commodity prices, pose risks to the inflation trajectory.\n\nEmerging global risks could challenge India's growth and inflation outlook. Higher crude oil prices due to Middle East tensions and tighter global oil supply pose a risk. Geopolitical tensions could also impact global supply chains, hurting India's exports and escalating costs. However, India's domestic economic resilience and momentum suggest it is well-equipped to navigate potential headwinds.\n\nThe financial performance of HDFC Bank remained healthy for the year ending March 31, 2024, with Total Net Revenue (Net Interest Income plus Other Income) rising by 33.6 percent to ₹1,57,773.5 crore from ₹1,18,057.1 crore in the previous year. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in both Net Interest Income and Other Income. Net Interest Income grew by 25.0 percent to ₹1,08,532.5 crore, with a Core Net Interest Margin of 3.53 percent."

The audit aimed to evaluate the bank's compliance with statutory provisions and adherence to good corporate practices. Based on the examination of statutory registers, books, papers, minute books, forms, returns, and information provided by the bank, its officers, agents, and authorized representatives, the report concludes that HDFC Bank Limited complied with the statutory provisions during the audit period. The bank followed proper Board processes and maintained a compliance mechanism.\n\nThe audit covered compliance with several key regulations and acts including: the Companies Act, 2013; the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956; the Depositories Act, 1996; the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 concerning Foreign Direct Investment, Overseas Direct Investment, and External Commercial Borrowings; and various regulations and guidelines under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 which includes regulations on substantial acquisition of shares and takeovers, prohibition of insider trading, issue of capital and disclosure requirements, share-based employee benefits and sweat equity, issue and listing of non-convertible securities, depositories and participants, bankers to an issue, merchant bankers, and foreign portfolio investors.

During the reviewed financial year, the bank addressed orders and show cause notices in the ordinary course of business by paying requisite penalties and making relevant public disclosures.\n\nThe report confirms that the Board of Directors is properly constituted with a balance of Executive, Non-Executive, and Independent Directors, and changes in the Board's composition complied with the Companies Act, 2013. Adequate notice, agendas, and detailed notes were provided for Board Meetings, allowing directors to seek further information and participate meaningfully. Decisions at Board and Committee meetings were accurately recorded in the minutes, including dissenting views if any. The Bank has adequate systems and processes to monitor and ensure compliance.\n\nKey events during the audit period include the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approving the Composite Scheme of Amalgamation, leading to the amalgamation of HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited with HDFC Limited, and subsequently HDFC Limited with HDFC Bank, effective July 1, 2023. As a result, the bank allotted 3,11,03,96,492 new equity shares to eligible shareholders of HDFC Limited, and outstanding non-convertible debentures issued by HDFC Limited were transferred to HDFC Bank.\n\nAlwyn Jay & Co.'s Secretarial Audit Report indicates that compliance with applicable laws is the responsibility of the bank's management, with the audit limited to verifying records and procedures on a test check basis. The firm followed appropriate audit practices to obtain reasonable assurance about the correctness of secretarial and legal records, compliance mechanisms, and corporate conduct. The report does not verify financial records or provide assurance of the bank's future viability or management's effectiveness.\n\nThe report also includes a disclosure on complaints and grievance redress, providing summary information on complaints received from customers and the RBI Ombudsman showing the number of complaints pending, received, and disposed during the financial years ending March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023. It further details maintainable complaints received from ORBIOs and their resolution status like complaints resolved in favor of the Bank by ORBIOs, complaints resolved through conciliation / mediation / advisories issued by ORBIOs and complaints resolved after passing of Awards by BOs against the Bank.\n\nFurthermore, the Directors report indicates compliance with corporate governance requirements as per Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015. HDFC Bank adheres to requirements pertaining to vigil mechanisms, related party transactions, corporate governance with respect to subsidiaries, secretarial audit and compliance reports, independent directors, obligations with respect to employees, and dissemination of information on its website. The bank maintains expenses related to the Part-Time Chairman's office and reimburses expenses incurred in the performance of duties. While the bank publishes results on its website and stock exchange websites, it does not send half-yearly declarations of financial performance separately to each shareholder. There were no audit qualifications in the bank's financial statements during the review period.

LLP, an independent firm of Chartered Accountants, on the Fit for Consolidation Pack of HDFC Securities Limited, a subsidiary of the Parent, contained an unmodified audit opinion and included a key audit matter regarding IT systems and controls. The audit highlighted that the Company's financial accounting and reporting systems heavily rely on IT systems and controls to manage significant transaction volumes, necessitating effective design and operation of automated accounting procedures and IT environment controls to ensure accurate financial reporting. Due to the pervasive nature and complexity of the IT environment, the assessment of general IT controls and application controls specific to accounting and preparation of financial information was identified as a key audit matter. To address this, specialized IT auditors assisted in performing procedures on the IT infrastructure and applications relevant to financial reporting, including testing the design and operating effectiveness of IT access controls, IT general controls (logical access, change management, and aspects of IT operational controls), the Company's periodic review of access rights, and requests for changes to systems. The audit also involved testing the design and operating effectiveness of compensating manual controls in case deficiencies were identified and, where necessary, extending the scope of substantive audit procedures."
