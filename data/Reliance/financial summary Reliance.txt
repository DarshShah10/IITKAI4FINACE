      "text": "\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Hedges that meet the criteria  for hedge \naccounting are accounted for as follows: \n\t\n\t\n\t\nA.\t\nCash Flow Hedge \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group designates derivative \ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \nAssets / Liabilities as hedging \ninstruments to mitigate the risk of \nmovement in interest rates and foreign \nexchange rates for foreign exchange \nexposure on highly probable future cash \nflows attributable to a recognised asset \nor liability or forecast cash transactions. \n\t\n\t\n\t\nB.\t\nFair Value Hedge \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group designates derivative \ncontracts or non-derivative Financial \nAssets / Liabilities as hedging \ninstruments to mitigate the risk of \nchange in fair value of hedged item due \nto movement in interest rates, foreign \nexchange rates and commodity prices.\n\t\n\t\niv.\t\nOffsetting \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are \noffset and the net amount is presented in \nthe balance sheet when, and only when, the \nGroup has a legally enforceable right to set \noff the amount and it intends, either to settle \nthem on a net basis or to realise the asset \nand settle the liability simultaneously. \n\t\n(n)\t Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Oil and Gas Joint Arrangement are in the nature of \njoint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities \nas well as income and expenditure are accounted \non the basis of available information on a line‑by-\nline basis with similar items in the Financial \nStatements, according to the participating \ninterest of the Group.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group follows the Guidance Note on \nAccounting for Oil and Gas producing activities \n– Ind AS issued by the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants of India for the purpose of \naccounting.  Seismic costs, geological and \ngeophysical studies, petroleum exploration \nlicense fees and general and administration costs \ndirectly attributable to exploration and evaluation \nactivities are expensed off. The costs incurred on \nacquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on \nexploration and evaluation other than those which \nare expensed off are accounted for as Intangible \nAssets Under Development. All development \ncosts incurred in respect of proved reserves are \nalso capitalised under Intangible Assets Under \nDevelopment. Once a well is ready to commence \ncommercial production, the costs accumulated \nin Intangible Assets Under Development are \nclassified as Intangible Assets corresponding \nto proved developed oil and gas reserves. The \nexploration and evaluation expenditure which \ndoes not result in discovery of proved oil and gas \nreserves and all cost pertaining to production are \ncharged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group uses technical estimation of reserves \nas per the Petroleum Resources Management \nSystem guidelines 2011 and standard geological \nand reservoir engineering methods. The reserve \nreview and evaluation is carried out annually. \nC.\t \u0007Critical Accounting Judgements and \nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\t\n\u0007The preparation of the Group’s financial statements \nrequire management to make judgement, estimates \nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the \naccompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these \nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes \nthat require a material adjustment to the carrying \namount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\t\n(A)\t \u0007Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The determination of the Group’s estimated \noil and natural gas reserves require significant \njudgements and estimates to be applied and these \nare regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such \nas the availability of geological and engineering \ndata, reservoir performance data, acquisition \nand divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and \ncommodity prices all impact on the determination \nof the Group’s estimates of its oil and natural gas \nreserves. The Group bases it’s proved reserves \nestimates on the requirement of reasonable \ncertainty with rigorous technical and commercial \nassessments based on conventional industry \npractice and regulatory requirements.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are \nused to calculate depletion charges for the \nGroup’s oil and gas properties. The impact of \nchanges in estimated proved reserves is dealt \nwith prospectively by amortising the remaining \ncarrying value of the asset over the expected \nfuture production. Oil and natural gas reserves \nalso have a direct impact on the assessment of the \nrecoverability of asset carrying values reported in \nthe financial statements.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Details on proved reserves and production both \non product and geographical basis are provided in \nNote 34.\n\t\n(B)\t \u0007Property Plant and Equipment / Other \nIntangible Assets\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Estimates are involved in determining the cost \nattributable to bringing the assets to the location \nand condition necessary for it to be capable \nof operating in the manner intended by the \nmanagement. Property, Plant and Equipment / \nOther Intangible Assets are depreciated /  \namortised over their estimated useful life, \nafter taking into account estimated residual \nvalue. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its \nbalance validity period, based on the expected \npattern of consumption of the expected future \neconomic benefits.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Management reviews the estimated useful life \nand residual values of the assets annually in \norder to determine the amount of depreciation / \namortisation to be recorded during any reporting \nperiod. The useful life and residual values are \nbased on the Group’s historical experience with \nsimilar assets and take into account anticipated \ntechnological and future risks. The depreciation / \namortisation for future periods is revised if there \nare significant changes from previous estimates.\n\t\n(C)\t Provisions\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The timing of recognition and quantification of \nthe liability (including litigations) requires the \napplication of judgement to existing facts and \ncircumstances, which can be subject to change. \nThe carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities \nare reviewed regularly and revised to take account \nof changing facts and circumstances.\n\t\n(D)\t \u0007Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible \nAssets under Development and Intangible \nAssets with Indefinite Useful Life\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Management reviews the carrying value of \ngoodwill, intangible assets under development \nand intangible assets with indefinite useful \nlife annually, to determine whether there has \nbeen any impairment by allocating the value of \ngoodwill, intangible assets under development \nand intangible assets with indefinite useful life \nto a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has \nidentified CGUs’ for this purpose, considering \nthe nature of the businesses to which each of the \nCGU relates.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Value in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU \nis aggregate of cash flow projections, for five \nyears as approved by Senior Management and \nbeyond five years extrapolated using a long-term \ngrowth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash \nflow projections are discounted by a pre-tax \ndiscount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of \nCapital (WACC), which ranges from 8% to 12%.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Management believes that any reasonably \npossible change in the above key assumptions on \nwhich recoverable amount is based would not \ncause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed \nthe aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite \nlives have been allocated to the respective CGUs. \nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the \nGroup has determined that there is no impairment \ntowards these assets.\n\t\n(E)\t \u0007Impairment of Financial and \nNon‑Financial Assets\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \nare based on assumptions about risk of default \nand expected cash loss rates. The Group uses \njudgement in making these assumptions and \nselecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, \nbased on Group’s past history, existing market \nconditions as well as forward-looking estimates at \nthe end of each reporting period.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007In case of non-financial assets, the Group \nestimates asset’s recoverable amount, which \nis higher of an asset’s or Cash Generating Units \n(CGU’s) fair value less costs of disposal and its \nvalue in use.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007In assessing value in use, the estimated future \ncash flows are discounted to their present value \nusing pre-tax discount rate that reflects current \nmarket assessments of the time value of money \nand the risks specific to the asset. In determining \nfair value less costs of disposal, recent market \ntransactions are taken into account, if no such \ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate \nvaluation model is used.\t\t\n\t\n(F)\t Fair Value Measurement\n\t\n\t\n\u0007For estimates relating to fair value of financial \ninstruments refer Note 37 of Consolidated \nFinancial Statements.\n\t\n(G)\t Leases\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies \nto be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS \n116. Identification of a lease requires significant \njudgement. The Group uses judgement in \nassessing whether a contract (or part of contract) \ninclude a lease, the lease term (including \nanticipated renewals), the applicable discount \nrate, variable lease payments whether are \nin-substance fixed. The judgement involves \nassessment of whether the asset included in the \ncontract is a fully or partly identified asset based \non the facts and circumstances, whether the \ncontract include a lease and non-lease component \nand if so, separation thereof for the purpose of \nrecognition and measurement, determination of \nlease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable \nperiod of lease and whether the lessee intends \nto opt for continuing with the use of the asset \nupon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease \npayments are fixed are variable or a combination \nof both.\n228\nReliance Industries Limited\n229\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\nNotes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\n"

      "text": "Sr. \nNo. Key Audit Matter\nAuditor’s Response\n3.\nInformation Technology (IT) systems and controls over \nfinancial reporting\nWe identified IT systems and controls over financial reporting \nas a key audit matter for the Company because its financial \naccounting and reporting systems are fundamentally reliant \non IT systems and IT controls to process significant transaction \nvolumes, specifically with respect to revenue and raw material \nconsumption. Also, due to such large transaction volumes \nand the increasing challenge to protect the integrity of the \nCompany’s systems and data, cyber security has become \nmore significant. Automated accounting procedures and \nIT environment controls, which include IT governance, IT \ngeneral controls over program development and changes, \naccess to program and data and IT operations, IT application \ncontrols and interfaces between IT applications, are required \nto be designed and to operate effectively to ensure accurate \nfinancial reporting.\nOur procedures included and were not limited to the following:\n\t\n−Assessed the complexity of the IT environment by engaging \nIT specialists and through discussion with the head of IT and \ninternal audit at the Company and identified IT applications \nthat are relevant to our audit.\n\t\n−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \nof IT general controls over program development and changes, \naccess to program and data and IT operations by engaging \nIT specialists.\n\t\n−Performed inquiry procedures with the head of cybersecurity \nat the Company in respect of the overall security architecture \nand any key threats addressed by the Company in the \ncurrent year.\n\t\n−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \nof IT application controls in the key processes impacting \nfinancial reporting of the Company by engaging IT specialists.\n\t\n−Tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness \nof controls relating to data transmission through the different \nIT systems to the financial reporting systems by engaging \nIT specialists.\nInformation Other than the Financial \nStatements and Auditor’s Report Thereon\n\t\n−The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \nother information. The other information comprises the \ninformation included in the Annual Report, but does \nnot include the Consolidated Financial Statements, \nStandalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s \nreport thereon.\n\t\n−Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements \ndoes not cover the other information and we do not \nexpress any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\t\n−In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial \nStatements, our responsibility is to read the other \ninformation and, in doing so, consider whether the \nother information is materially inconsistent with the \nStandalone Financial Statements, or our knowledge \nobtained during the course of our audit or otherwise \nappears to be materially misstated.\n\t\n−If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude \nthat there is a material misstatement of this other \ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We \nhave nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and \nThose Charged with Governance for the \nStandalone Financial Statements\nThe Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the \nmatters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to \nthe preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements \nthat give a true and fair view of the financial position, \nfinancial performance including other comprehensive \nincome, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company \nin accordance with the accounting principles generally \naccepted in India, including Ind AS specified under \nSection 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes \nmaintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of \nthe Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and \nother irregularities; selection and application of appropriate \naccounting policies; making judgments and estimates that \nare reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation \nand maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, \nthat were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy \nand completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the \npreparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial \nStatements that give a true and fair view and are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, \nmanagement and Board of Directors is responsible for \nassessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting \nunless the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate \nthe Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic \nalternative but to do so.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for \noverseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the \nStandalone Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole \nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \nor error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted \nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material \nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from \nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually \nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis \nof these Standalone Financial Statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \nthroughout the audit. We also:\n\t\n−Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due \nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence \nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \nfor our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or \nthe override of internal control.\n\t\n−Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls \nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under \nSection 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible \nfor expressing our opinion on whether the Company \nhas adequate internal financial controls with reference \nto Standalone Financial Statements in place and the \noperating effectiveness of such controls.\n\t\n−Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by the management.\n\t\n−Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use \nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions \nthat may cast significant doubt on the Company’s \nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude \nthat a material uncertainty exists, we are required to \ndraw attention in our auditor’s report to the related \ndisclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements \nor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify \nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit \nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. \nHowever, future events or conditions may cause the \nCompany to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\t\n−Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \nof the Standalone Financial Statements, including the \ndisclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial \nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \nStandalone Financial Statements that, individually or in \naggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions \nof a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone \nFinancial Statements may be influenced. We consider \nquantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning \nthe scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results \nof our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified \nmisstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance \nregarding, among other matters, the planned scope and \ntiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including \nany significant deficiencies in internal controls with \nreference to financial statements that we identify during \nour audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a \nstatement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and to communicate \nwith them all relationships and other matters that may \nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and \nwhere applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with \ngovernance, we determine those matters that were of \nmost significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial \nStatements of the current period and are therefore the key \naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s \nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \nwe determine that a matter should not be communicated \nin our report because the adverse consequences of doing \nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public \ninterest benefits of such communication.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory \nRequirements\n1.\t\n\u0007As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our \naudit, we report that:\n\t\na)\t\n\u0007We have sought and obtained all the information \nand explanations which to the best of our \nknowledge and belief were necessary for the \npurposes of our audit.\n120\nReliance Industries Limited\n121\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\n"

The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s \njudgement, including the assessment of the risks of material \nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \nfraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit \nopinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with \nreference to Standalone Financial Statements.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls \nwith reference to Standalone Financial \nStatements\nA company’s internal financial control with reference to \nStandalone Financial Statements is a process designed \nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial \nstatements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles.

      "text": "in Intangible Assets Under Development are \nclassified as Intangible Assets corresponding \nto proved developed oil and gas reserves. The \nexploration and evaluation expenditure which \ndoes not result in discovery of proved oil and gas \nreserves and all cost pertaining to production are \ncharged to the Statement of Profit and Loss. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Company uses technical estimation of \nreserves as per the Petroleum Resources \nManagement System guidelines 2011 and \nstandard geological and reservoir engineering \nmethods. The reserve review and evaluation is \ncarried out annually.\nC.\t \u0007Critical Accounting Judgements and \nKey Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\t\n\u0007The preparation of the Company’s Financial Statements \nrequires management to make judgement, estimates \nand assumptions that affect the reported amount \nof revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the \naccompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these \nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes \nthat require a material adjustment to the carrying \namount of assets or liabilities affected in next \nfinancial years.\n(A)\t Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\t\n\u0007The determination of the Company’s estimated oil and \nnatural gas reserves requires significant judgements \nand estimates to be applied and these are regularly \nreviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability \nof geological and engineering data, reservoir \nperformance data, acquisition and divestment activity, \ndrilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact \non the determination of the Company’s estimates of \nits oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases \nit’s proved reserves estimates on the requirement \nof reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and \ncommercial assessments based on conventional \nindustry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\t\n\u0007Estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used \nto calculate depletion charges for the Company’s \noil and gas properties. The impact of changes in \nestimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively \nby amortising the remaining carrying value of the \nasset over the expected future production. Oil and \nnatural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the \nassessment of the recoverability of asset carrying \nvalues reported in the Financial Statements.\n\t\n\u0007Details on proved reserves and production both \non product and geographical basis are provided in \nNote 35.2.\n(B)\t \u0007Property Plant and Equipment/ Intangible \nAssets\n\t\n\u0007Estimates are involved in determining the cost \nattributable to bringing the assets to the location and \ncondition necessary for it to be capable of operating in \nthe manner intended by the management. Property, \nPlant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/\namortised over their estimated useful life, after taking \ninto account estimated residual value. Management \nreviews the estimated useful life and residual values of \nthe assets annually in order to determine the amount \nof depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during \nany reporting period. The useful life and residual values \nare based on the Company’s historical experience \nwith similar assets and take into account anticipated \ntechnological and future risks. The depreciation/\namortisation for future periods is revised if there are \nsignificant changes from previous estimates.\n(C)\t Provisions\n\t\n\u0007The timing of recognition and quantification of the \nliability (including litigations) requires the application \nof judgement to existing facts and circumstances, \nwhich can be subject to change. The carrying amounts \nof provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly \nand revised to take account of changing facts \nand circumstances.\n(D)\t \u0007Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial \nAssets\n\t\n\u0007The impairment provisions for Financial Assets \nare based on assumptions about risk of default \nand expected cash loss rates. The Company uses \njudgement in making these assumptions and selecting \nthe inputs to the impairment calculation, based on \nCompany’s past history, existing market conditions as \nwell as forward-looking estimates at the end of each \nreporting period.\n\t\n\u0007In case of non-financial assets, assessment of \nimpairment indicators involves consideration of \nfuture risks. Further, the Company estimates asset’s \nrecoverable amount, which is higher of an asset’s or \nCash Generating Units (CGU’s) fair value less costs of \ndisposal and its value in use.\n\t\n\u0007In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash \nflows are discounted to their present value using \npre-tax discount rate that reflects current market \nassessments of the time value of money and the risks \nspecific to the asset. In determining fair value less \ncosts of disposal, recent market transactions are taken \ninto account, if no such transactions can be identified, \nan appropriate valuation model is used.\n(E)\t Fair Value Measurement\n\t\n\u0007For estimates relating to fair value of financial \ninstruments refer note 38 of financial statements.\n1. \t\n Property, Plant & Equipment, Intangible Assets, Capital Work-in-Progress and Intangible Assets Under Development.\n(C in crore)\nDescription\nGross Block\nDepreciation / Amortisation and Depletion\nNet Block\nAs at \n01-04-\n2023\nAdditions / \nAdjustments \nDeductions /\nAdjustments\nAs at \n31-03-\n2024\nAs at \n01-04-\n2023\nFor the \nYear#\nDeductions / \nAdjustments\nAs at \n31-03-\n2024\nAs at \n31-03-\n2024\nAs at \n31-03-\n2023\nProperty, Plant and \nEquipment\nOwn Assets:\nLand \n38,966\n8\n-\n38,974\n-\n-\n-\n-\n38,974\n38,966\nBuildings \n26,868\n5,574\n82\n32,360\n9,403\n790\n64\n10,129\n22,231\n17,465\nPlant & Machinery \n2,72,637\n6,798\n1,049\n2,78,386\n1,18,582\n5,134\n890\n1,22,826\n1,55,560\n1,54,055\nElectrical Installations \n8,709\n1,049\n76\n9,682\n4,877\n650\n76\n5,451\n4,231\n3,832\nEquipments $\n23,563\n2,249\n14\n25,798\n5,070\n2,728\n13\n7,785\n18,013\n18,493\nFurniture & Fixtures \n935\n247\n2\n1,180\n519\n84\n2\n601\n579\n416\nVehicles \n1,007\n109\n15\n1,101\n644\n131\n14\n761\n340\n363\nShips \n508\n4\n-\n512\n373\n12\n-\n385\n127\n135\nAircrafts & Helicopters \n46\n-\n-\n46\n42\n1\n-\n43\n3\n4\nSub-Total\n3,73,239\n16,038\n1,238\n3,88,039\n1,39,510\n9,530\n1,059\n1,47,981\n2,40,058\n2,33,729\nRight-of-Use Assets:\nLand\n17,689\n-\n-\n17,689\n2,045\n172\n-\n2,217\n15,472\n15,644\nPlant & Machinery \n4,619\n-\n-\n4,619\n1,025\n213\n-\n1,238\n3,381\n3,594\nShips \n10\n-\n-\n10\n10\n-\n-\n10\n-\n-\nSub-Total \n22,318\n-\n-\n22,318\n3,080\n385\n-\n3,465\n18,853\n19,238\nTotal (A) \n3,95,557\n16,038\n1,238\n4,10,357\n1,42,590\n9,915\n1,059\n1,51,446\n2,58,911\n2,52,967\nIntangible Assets *\nTechnical Knowhow Fees \n4,665\n4\n-\n4,669\n3,534\n107\n-\n3,641\n1,028\n1,131\nSoftware \n1,060\n100\n-\n1,160\n946\n37\n-\n983\n177\n114\nDevelopment Rights \n63,534\n18,451\n-\n81,985\n35,535\n7,173\n-\n42,708\n39,277\n27,999\nOthers \n1,745\n681\n-\n2,426\n1,655\n534\n-\n2,189\n237\n90\nTotal (B) \n71,004\n19,236\n-\n90,240\n41,670\n7,851\n-\n49,521\n40,719\n29,334\nTotal (A + B) \n4,66,561\n35,274\n1,238\n5,00,597\n1,84,260\n17,766\n1,059\n2,00,967\n2,99,630\n2,82,301\nPrevious Year\n4,13,733\n54,643\n1,815\n4,66,561\n1,74,107\n11,256\n1,103\n1,84,260\n2,82,301\n2,39,626\nCapital Work-in-\nProgress\n44,294\n30,972\nIntangible Assets under \nDevelopment\n17,338\n23,385\n\t\n# \u0007Depreciation / Amortisation and Depletion Expense for the year includes depreciation of C 76 crore (Previous Year C 75 crore) capitalised during \nthe year.

Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance \nfunction, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \nactivities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group \nGuarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group \nrestricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\t\n\t\niv)\t\nLiquidity Risk\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains \nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local \nfinancial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient \nfunding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash \nflow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury \npools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or \ninvest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, \nmoney market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid \nconcentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n(C in crore)\nParticulars\nMaturity Profile As at 31st March, 2024 *\nBelow\n3 Months\n3-6 \nMonths\n6-12 \nMonths\n1-3 \nYears\n3-5 \nYears\nAbove \n5 Years\nTotal\nBorrowings\nNon-Current #@\n 10,675 \n 5,945 \n 28,897 \n 59,432 \n 96,280 \n 68,443  2,69,672 \nCurrent ^\n 56,462 \n 253 \n 153 \n -   \n -   \n -   \n 56,868 \nTotal\n 67,137 \n 6,198 \n 29,050 \n 59,432 \n 96,280 \n 68,443  3,26,540 \nLease Liabilities (Gross)\n 1,591 \n 1,401 \n 2,692 \n 9,680 \n4,725\n 16,854\n36,943\nDerivative Liabilities\nForwards\n 1,858 \n 820 \n812\n 93 \n62\n -   \n3,645\nOptions\n 62 \n 10 \n 23 \n 33 \n 36 \n -   \n 164 \nCurrency Swaps\n-\n-\n2\n34\n260\n3\n299\nInterest Rate Swaps\n 4   \n -   \n -   \n 126 \n - \n -   \n 130\nTotal\n 1,924 \n 830 \n837\n 286 \n358\n 3 \n4,238\n\t\n\t\n\t\n* Does not include Trade Payables (Current) amounting to C 1,78,377 crore.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n# Includes C 1,582 crore as Prepaid Finance Charges and C 110 crore as fair valuation impact.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.4).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n^ Includes C 226 crore as Commercial Paper Discount.\n276\nReliance Industries Limited\n277\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\nNotes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\n"

We have \nalways believed that the demand \nfor India’s age-old crafts is at par \nwith prominent global brands, and \nour belief has been vindicated by \nthe overwhelming response to our \nSwadesh stores.\nThe world is now realising the \nenormous potential of India. \n‘Invest in India’ is being advocated \nglobally.

Record viewership of the \nIndian Premier League on JioCinema \nunderscored our ability to scale-up \naudience on our digital platform in a \nshort time. \nDuring the year, we entered into a \nlandmark agreement with The Walt \nDisney Company, world’s leading \nmedia company, for creating a \njoint venture which combines the \nbusinesses of Viacom 18 and Star \nIndia. The resultant JV will be one \nof the leading television and digital \nstreaming platforms in India, bringing \nbest-in-class entertainment for our \naudience across the country.\nOil to Chemicals\nProduct cracks for transportation \nfuels remained strong albeit lower \nthan the previous year.

The Company is generally \nthe principal as it typically controls the goods or \nservices before transferring them to the customer.\u0007\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Revenue is measured at the amount of \nconsideration which the Company expects to be \nentitled to in exchange for transferring distinct \ngoods or services to a customer as specified in \nthe contract, excluding amounts collected on \nbehalf of third parties (for example taxes and \nduties collected on behalf of the government). \nConsideration is generally due upon satisfaction \nof performance obligations and a receivable is \nrecognised when it becomes unconditional. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007Generally, the credit period varies between \n0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of \ngoods or completion of services as the case may \nbe. The Company provides volume rebates to \ncertain customers once the quantity of products \npurchased during the period exceeds a threshold \nspecified and also accrues discounts to certain \ncustomers based on customary business practices \nwhich is derived on the basis of crude price \nvolatility and various market demand – supply \nsituations.

Other Financial \nAssets are generally measured at Fair Value \nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL) except \nwhere the Company, based on the business \nmodel objectives, measures these at \nAmortized Cost or Fair Value Through Other \nComprehensive Income (FVTOCI).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Company uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ \n(ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of \nFinancial Assets other than those measured \nat Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Expected Credit Losses are measured \nthrough a loss allowance at an amount \nequal to: \n\t\n−The 12-months expected credit losses \n(expected credit losses that result from \nthose default events on the financial \ninstrument that are possible within 12 \nmonths after the reporting date); or \n\t\n−Full lifetime expected credit losses \n(expected credit losses that result from \nall possible default events over the life of \nthe financial instrument).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007For Trade Receivables, the Company \napplies ‘simplified approach’ which requires \nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Company uses historical default rates to \ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \nthese historical default rates are reviewed \nand changes in the forward-looking estimates \nare analysed. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007For other assets, the Company uses 12 \nmonth ECL to provide for impairment loss \nwhere there is no significant increase in \ncredit risk.

If the effect of the \ntime value of money is material, provisions are \ndiscounted using a current pre-tax rate that \nreflects, when appropriate, the risks specific \nto the liability. When discounting is used, the \nincrease in the provision due to the passage of \ntime is recognised as a finance cost. \n\t\n\t\nProvision for Decommissioning Liability\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group records a provision for \ndecommissioning costs towards site restoration \nactivity. Decommissioning costs are provided \nat the present value of future expenditure using \na current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred \nto fulfil decommissioning obligations and are \nrecognised as part of the cost of the underlying \nassets. Any change in the present value of the \nexpenditure, other than unwinding of discount \non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to \nthe provision and the corresponding asset. The \nchange in the provision due to the unwinding \nof discount is recognised in the Consolidated \nStatement of Profit and Loss.\n\t\n(h)\t Contingent Liabilities\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Disclosure of contingent liability is made when \nthere is a possible obligation arising from past \nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed \nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one \nor more uncertain future events not wholly within \nthe control of the Group or a present obligation \nthat arises from past events where it is either not \nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying \neconomic benefits will be required to settle or a \nreliable estimate of amount cannot be made. \n\t\n(i)\t Current Tax and Deferred Tax \n\t\n\t\n\u0007The tax expenses for the period comprise \nof current tax and deferred tax. The Group \nexercises judgment in computation of current tax \nconsidering the relevant rulings and reassesses \nthe carrying amount of deferred tax assets / \nliabilities at the end of each reporting period. \n\t\n(j)\t Share Based Payments\n\t\n\t\n\u0007In case of Group equity-settled share-based \npayment transactions, where the Company grants \nstock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, \nthe transactions are accounted by increasing \nthe cost of investment in subsidiary with a \ncorresponding credit in the equity. \n\t\n(k)\t \u0007Foreign Currencies Transactions and \nTranslation\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Exchange gains or losses on foreign currency \nborrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which \nare related to the acquisition or construction of \nqualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost \nof such assets.\n\t\n(l)\t Revenue Recognition\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Revenue from contracts with customers is \nrecognised when control of the goods or services \nare transferred to the customer at an amount that \nreflects the consideration entitled in exchange for \nthose goods or services. The Group is generally \nthe principal as it typically controls the goods or \nservices before transferring them to the customer.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration \nwhich the Group expects to be entitled to in \nexchange for transferring distinct goods or \nservices to a customer as specified in the contract, \nexcluding amounts collected on behalf of third \nparties (for example taxes and duties collected \non behalf of the government). Consideration is \ngenerally due upon satisfaction of performance \nobligations and a receivable is recognised when it \nbecomes unconditional. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 \ndays from the shipment or delivery of goods or \ncompletion of services as the case may be. The \nGroup provides volume rebates to certain customers \nonce the quantity of products purchased during \nthe period exceeds a threshold specified and also \naccrues discounts to certain customers based on \ncustomary business practices which is derived \non the basis of crude price volatility and various \nmarket demand – supply situations. Consideration \nare determined based on its most likely amount. \nGenerally, sales of petroleum products contain \nprovisional pricing features where revenue is initially \nrecognised based on provisional price. Difference \nbetween final settlement price and provisional price \nis recognised subsequently.\n\t\n(m)\tFinancial Instruments\n\t\n\t\ni.\t\nFinancial Assets\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are \nrecognised using trade date accounting. \nTrade receivables that do not contain \na significant financing component are \nmeasured at transaction price.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Company has elected to account for its \ninvestments in associates and joint venture at \ncost less impairment loss (if any). \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007All other equity investments are measured \nat fair value, with value changes recognised \nin Statement of Profit and Loss, except \nfor those equity investments for which \nthe Group has elected to present the \nvalue changes in ‘Other Comprehensive \nIncome’. However, dividend on such equity \ninvestments are recognised in Statement \nof Profit and Loss when the Company’s \nright to receive payment is established. The \ninvestments in preference shares with the \nright to surplus assets which are in nature \nof equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are \ntreated as separate category of investment \nand measured at Fair Value Through Other \nComprehensive Income (FVTOCI). Other \nFinancial Assets are generally measured at \nFair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) \nexcept where the Group, based on the \nbusiness model objectives, measures these \nat Amortized Cost or Fair Value Through \nOther Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group uses ‘Expected Credit Loss’ (ECL) \nmodel, for evaluating impairment of Financial \nAssets other than those measured at Fair \nValue Through Profit Or Loss (FVTPL).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Expected Credit Losses are measured \nthrough a loss allowance at an amount \nequal to: \n\t\n−The 12-months expected credit losses \n(expected credit losses that result from \nthose default events on the financial \ninstrument that are possible within 12 \nmonths after the reporting date); or \n\t\n−Full lifetime expected credit losses \n(expected credit losses that result from \nall possible default events over the life of \nthe financial instrument).\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007For Trade Receivables, the Group applies \n‘simplified approach’ which requires \nexpected lifetime losses to be recognised \nfrom initial recognition of the receivables. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group uses historical default rates to \ndetermine impairment loss on the portfolio \nof trade receivables. At every reporting date \nthese historical default rates are reviewed \nand changes in the forward-looking estimates \nare analysed.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007For other assets, the Group uses 12 month \nECL to provide for impairment loss where \nthere is no significant increase in credit risk. \nIf there is significant increase in credit risk \nfull lifetime ECL is used. \n\t\n\t\nii.\t\nFinancial Liabilities \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007For trade and other payables maturing \nwithin one year from the balance sheet \ndate, the carrying amounts are determined \nto approximate fair value due to the short \nmaturity of these instruments.\n\t\n\t\niii.\t\n\u0007Derivative Financial Instruments and \nHedge Accounting \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group uses various derivative financial \ninstruments such as interest rate swaps, \ncurrency swaps, forwards & options and \ncommodity contracts to mitigate the risk \nof changes in interest rates, exchange rates \nand commodity prices. At the inception of \na hedge relationship, the Group formally \ndesignates and documents the hedge \nrelationship to which the Group wishes \nto apply hedge accounting and the risk \nmanagement objective and strategy for \nundertaking the hedge. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Any gains or losses arising from changes in \nthe fair value of derivatives are taken directly \nto Statement of Profit and Loss, except for \nthe effective portion of cash flow hedge \nwhich is recognised in Other Comprehensive \nIncome and later to Statement of Profit and \nLoss when the hedged item affects profit \nor loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a \nhedged forecast transaction subsequently \nresults in the recognition of a Non-Financial \nAssets or Non-Financial liabilities. \n226\nReliance Industries Limited\n227\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\nNotes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2024\n"

The Company restricts its fixed \nincome investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\t\niv)\t\nLiquidity Risk\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Liquidity risk arises from the Company’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Company maintains \nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Company accesses global and local financial \nmarkets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient funding from \nacross well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s cash flow position and \nensures that the Company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Company’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury \npools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the \nnet surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, \nreverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one \ninstrument or counterparty.\n(C in crore)\nParticulars ^\nMaturity Profile as at 31st March, 2024\nBelow \n3 Months\n3-6 Months\n6-12 Months\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nAbove \n5 Years\nTotal\nBorrowings\nNon-Current *@\n9,936\n2,587\n21,143\n34,149\n61,009\n66,827\n1,95,651\nCurrent $\n17,298\n - \n - \n - \n - \n - \n17,298\nTotal\n27,234\n2,587\n21,143\n34,149\n61,009\n66,827\n2,12,949\nLease Liabilities (Gross)\n81\n81\n150\n552\n552\n4,024\n5,440\nDerivative Liabilities\nForwards\n759\n447\n650\n49\n57\n - \n1,962\nOptions\n62\n10\n23\n33\n36\n - \n164\nInterest Rate Swaps\n - \n - \n2\n34\n260\n 3 \n299\nTotal\n821\n457\n675\n116\n353\n3\n2,425\n\t\n\t\n^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) of C 1,29,859 crore.\n\t\n\t\n* Including C 1,159 crore as prepaid financial charges and fair valuation impact.\n\t\n\t\n@ Does not include interest thereon (For Interest rate refer Note 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4).\n\t\n\t\n$ Interest rate on current borrowings ranges from 6.8% to 8.5%.\n(C in crore)\nParticulars ^\nMaturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023\nBelow \n3 Months\n3-6 Months\n6-12 Months\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\nAbove \n5 Years\nTotal\nBorrowings\nNon-Current *@\n12,633\n7,389\n24,053\n56,150\n21,040\n59,234\n1,80,499\nCurrent $\n33,985\n2,387\n0\n0\n0\n0\n36,372\nTotal\n46,618\n9,776\n24,053\n56,150\n21,040\n59,234\n2,16,871\nLease Liabilities (Gross)\n81\n81\n161\n587\n552\n4,301\n5,763\nDerivative Liabilities\nForwards\n645\n389\n314\n71\n4\n0\n1,423\nOptions\n103\n20\n63\n35\n0\n0\n221\nInterest Rate Swaps\n3\n13\n44\n38\n46\n3\n147\nTotal\n751\n422\n421\n144\n50\n 3 \n1,791\n\t\n\t\n^ Does not include Trade Payables (Current) of C 1,19,811 crore.\n\t\n\t\n* Including C 1,048 crore as prepaid financial charges and fair valuation impact.\n\t\n\t\n@ Does not include interest thereon (for interest rate Refer Note 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4).\n\t\n\t\n$ Interest rate of current borrowings ranges from 5.6% to 8.5%.\nC.\t\nHedge Accounting\n\t\n\u0007The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other \nfeedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates.

      "text": "Sr. \nNo. Key Audit Matter\nAuditor’s Response\n3. Revenue Recognition\n(a)\t\n\u0007The auditors of Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (‘RJIL’), \na step-down subsidiary of the Parent, have reported \nrevenue recognition as a key audit matter due to the high \nvolumes of data processed by the IT systems and the \ncomplexity of those IT systems.\nIn respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \nRJIL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by \nthem to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary \nauditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and \nwere not limited to the following:\n\t\n−Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and \noperating effectiveness of the relevant business process \ncontrols, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement \nand authorisation of revenue transactions, involving internal \nInformation Technology (IT) specialists for the automated \ncontrols, interface controls and reports generated through \nvarious relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.\n\t\n−Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment \ninter-alia for access controls, change management and \napplication specific controls in the IT Systems over RJIL’s billing \nand other relevant support systems.\n\t\n−Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue \nper the billing system and the financial records. Performed \nprocedures to test the computation of revenue and \ndeferred revenue.\n(b)\t\n\u0007The auditors of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (‘RRVL’), \na subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue \nrecognition as a key audit matter at its subsidiary \nviz., Reliance Retail Limited (‘RRL’). RRL is engaged in \norganised retail and the trading transactions generating \nrevenue comprising of high volume of individually small \ntransactions which increases the risk of revenue being \nrecognised inappropriately and which highlights the \ncriticality of sound internal processes of summarising \nand recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption \nbaskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of \nconsideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised \non transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. \nTransfer of control coincides with collection of cash or \ncash equivalent from customers. In view of the above \nand since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, \nrevenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.\nIn respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of \nRRVL, we performed inquiry of the audit procedure performed by \nthem to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary \nauditors, the audit procedures performed by them included and \nwere not limited to the following:\n\t\n−Obtained understanding of the process followed by the \nmanagement to record the revenue from each store.\n\t\n−Evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of \nthe internal controls established by RRL over reconciliation of \nrevenue recorded with underlying collection made by RRL.\n\t\n−Involved information technology specialist to test the \nautomated controls and reports involved in the reconciliation \nof revenue.\n\t\n−On a test-check basis, selected samples of stores on various \ndates. For such selections, obtained details of revenue \nrecorded through various modes of payment from RRL’s \naccounting system. Reconciled revenue recorded as per such \ndetails with the underlying collection made by RRL as per \ncash receipts, merchant payment reports, and other third \nparty supporting.\n4.
