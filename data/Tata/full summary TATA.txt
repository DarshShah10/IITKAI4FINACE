Several \npotential technology solutions are \nbeing evaluated and developed for \ndecarbonisation of Tata Steel’s steel \noperations globally. Given the options \nat various stages of development, and \na bouquet of solutions is expected to \nemerge over the next decade for the \nIndia operations.  \nTata Steel continues to promote \ncircularity. Tata Steel UK has \nannounced its decision to close its \nexisting blast-furnace based heavy \nend operations and transition its entire \nsteel production to a ~3 MTPA electric \narc furnace (EAF) to be commissioned \naround end 2027, which will rely \nlargely on available local scrap in the \nUK and reduce direct CO2 emissions in \nits operations by ~5 MTPA. Tata Steel \nalready operates electric arc furnace-\nbased steelmaking facilities in \nThailand, which recycle steel scrap \nand have a very low CO2 emission \nintensity. The Company is setting up \nits first scrap-based greenfield EAF \nsteelmaking facility in India, in Punjab. \nTata Steel will also explore expanding \nthe same process route to other \nlocations in India. \nAs a founding member of TCFD \n(Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures), Tata Steel \nplayed a crucial role in developing \nthe TCFD standard. It is also one of \nthe first companies in India to have \nadopted the recommendations \nof TCFD, pursuant to which it has \nundertaken extensive physical climate \nrisk assessments and transition \nclimate risk assessments using \nindependent third-party experts \nacross all its major steelmaking sites \nin line with the recommendations and \nincorporated them in its Enterprise \nRisk Management Framework. \nThis report discusses the four pillars \nof TCFD: \nRainwater harvesting park, Noamundi\nClimate Change Report aligned \nwith the Recommendations of \nthe Taskforce on Climate-Related \nFinancial Disclosures.\nSteel is a material of choice for \neconomic growth and development \nworldwide, be it infrastructure, \nconstruction, energy, capital goods, \nconveyance, automotive, packaging, \nsustainable homes, and many other \nsectors. While it is the foundation of \nsustainable economic growth, the \nsteel industry, like cement, power, \nchemical refining, airlines, etc. is a \nhard-to-abate sector from a climate \nchange perspective. \n70% of global steel production \noccurs through the traditional \nblast furnace route using coal as a \nreductant. While cost-effective and \nyielding high-quality output, the \nprocess creates a significant carbon \nfootprint. Though the electric arc \nfurnace production route, which \nutilises scrap which is comparatively \nsustainable, its range of value-added \nsteel grades remains limited. The \nlimited availability of scrap is also \na challenge as most scrap metal is \navailable in economically advanced \nregions, such as the US and Europe, \nwhich have a long history of \ninfrastructure investment.\nSteel producers worldwide are \nconfronted with finding ways to \nreduce the emissions generated by \nsteel production. These pathways will \nneed to consider the availability of \nresources in specific regions, ensure \na fair transition for the ecosystem \nand supply chain, and provide a \nfinancially viable and technologically \nsustainable solution.\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, \nTata Steel places a strong emphasis on \nenvironmental, social and governance \naspects in its corporate strategy. \nIn the FY2022-23, the Company \nadopted the target to be Net Zero \nby 2045 across its operations.

Municipal solid waste dump transformed into \na lush green picnic area\nIndia \nIndia is currently the second-\nlargest steel-producing country in \nthe world. The National Steel Policy \nof India envisages 300 MT of annual \nsteel production in India by 2030, and \nlocal demand is expected to continue \nincreasing 4-5 times the current levels \nby the middle of this century. To \ncapitalise on the opportunity,  \nTata Steel has a stated ambition to \ndouble its steelmaking capacity in \nIndia to 40 MTPA. \nIndia's growth trajectory poses \ndecarbonisation challenges for the \nblast furnace-dominated domestic \nsteel industry.

Carbon \ncapture and storage technologies are \nnascent, while technology solutions for \nsubstituting carbon in blast furnaces \nare at the pilot or concept stage. \nAs yet, India has no regulated \nmarket or defined allocation of carbon \ncredits to industry, which is necessary \nto build an economic framework and \nthe foundation for the investment \nthesis for decarbonisation. It may \nbe noted that India has already \nintroduced the requisite legislation for \nan Indian carbon market through The \nEnergy Conservation (Amendment) \nBill, 2022. The Indian Carbon Market \nis being developed by the Bureau of \nEnergy Efficiency in India. Initially, it \nis expected to cover select sectors, \nincluding the iron and steel sector, and \nthen gradually expand to cover other \nsectors. The form and coverage of the \nIndian Carbon Market are expected to \nplay a crucial role in India's emission \nreduction trajectory.\nTata Steel's transition strategy will \nseek to reduce reliance on fossil fuels \nin India progressively and will take \ninto consideration both the regulatory \ndevelopment and the Company's \ndecarbonisation ambitions: \n \nInstallation and commissioning of \nmodular scrap-based EAF plants \nstrategically in India in scrap \ngenerating regions \nIncreasing the share of renewable \nenergy in the power mix\nUsing higher amounts of scrap in its \nexisting ore-based BOF steelmaking \nprocess assets\nReduction in use of coal by utilising \nlower CO2 emission fuels such as \nbiochar, natural gas, and coke \noven gas\nPiloting new low TRL (Technology \nReadiness Level) technologies \nin partnership with academia \nand OEMs (Original Equipment \nManufacturers)\nTata Steel has adopted 'Leadership \nin Sustainability' as one of the four \nlong-term strategic objectives. The \nManagement undertakes climate \nrisk assessment and identification \nof potential mitigation actions \nthrough a cascaded process \nacross the organisation, which its \nBoard of Directors then reviews. \nThe Board has constituted specific \ncommittees (including the executive \ndirectors representing the business) \nwhich take a comprehensive approach \nto assessing climate risks and \nimpacts and recommend appropriate \nstrategies to deal with them:\n\t»\nCorporate Social Responsibility and \nSustainability Committee \n\t»\nSafety, Health and Environment \nCommittee \n\t»\nRisk Management Committee \nUnder the supervision of the Board, \nTata Steel's CEO & MD chairs the \nApex Environment and Sustainability \nCommittee. The committee sets the \nstrategic objectives, reviews and \nmonitors actions and performance, \nidentifies risks, and proposes \nmitigation plans and new initiatives. \nThe operating teams then develop \nthe strategy, evaluate options, engage \nwith relevant internal and external \nstakeholders, and pursue responsible \nadvocacy to shape policy and carry out \nprojects proactively. \nTata Steel has also created the \nCentre of Excellence (CoE) for GHG \nEmissions for greenhouse gas reduction \nand mitigation. It is chaired by the \nVice President - Safety, Health and \nSustainability and has cross-functional \nmembers from all parts of the \norganisation. The CoE for GHG Emissions \nalso governs the budget against the \nsustainability corpus to support projects \nin reducing carbon emissions and water \nconsumption. \nTata Steel has formulated a \nDecarbonisation Governance framework \nfor continued monitoring, evaluation, and \nreporting of decarbonisation initiatives. \nIt consists of 4 Vice-President led Tribes, \nto lead decarbonisation projects in \nrespective focus areas, reporting to \na steering committee chaired by the \nCEO & MD. The Project Management \nOffice, led by Vice President - Safety, \nHealth & Sustainability, drives project \nimplementation.\nTata Steel's subsidiary companies' \nboards set their respective sustainability \ngoals, which are aligned with Tata Steel's \nclimate risk strategy and Net Zero by 2045 \nambition. The Company's businesses \nin Europe have set themselves more \naccelerated decarbonisation targets given \nthe climate regulatory framework in the \nEuropean Union and the UK and societal \npriorities. The CEO & MD and ED & CFO \nof Tata Steel also chair the boards of key \nsubsidiary companies, which facilitates \nthe alignment of ESG governance across \nbusinesses and regions. \nWithin the strategic \ntransition framework \nto low carbon business \nconfiguration, Tata Steel's \ndecarbonisation pathway is \nnuanced in each geography \nbased on local regulatory \ncontext, policy support, \ncompetitively priced green \nenergy availability and \nthe associated delivery \ninfrastructure and customers' \nwillingness to pay for \ngreen steel. \nA.

For the disposal of such waste, the Company contracts with authorised recyclers and files returns with the appropriate \nstatutory bodies. Tata Steel has optimised its processes to the point where over 98% of the waste produced across all \ngeographies is either recycled and reused in its operations or sold as co-products to other industries, with the largest \ncustomer being the cement industry.

The Company also plans to collaborate with its customers to conduct a cradle-to-grave LCA study to comprehend \nthe impact of its products.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel UK is widely recognised for its expertise in LCA. By taking a supply chain perspective, the Company demonstrates \nhow improvements in material utilisation and right-first-time manufacturing can reduce emissions during the production \nphase. Its LCA models allow it to consider the complete value chain, for instance the impact of the carbon intensity of \nregional grid electricity (gCO2/kWh) on the carbon footprint of a vehicle or building. To extend its capability in this area, Tata \nSteel UK developed the PACI (Product Assessment Carbon Indicator) tool. This streamlines the process of undertaking life \ncycle studies of products and enables an understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission hotspots and trade-offs in the \nsteel product value chain, which can be used to inform new product developments and optimise existing manufacturing \nroutes. PACI has been used to support collaborative projects with customers and to support sharing and learning about \nopportunities for emissions reduction over the product’s life cycle from manufacture through to use and finally end-of-life: \nfor example, working with an automotive OEM to examine all aspects of materials selection, including material type, steel \ngrade, gauge, and aspects of formability and part design. Another example has been the use of the tool in understanding \nthe trade-off between benefits in use from improving motor efficiency versus embodied GHG emissions associated with \ndifferent grades of electrical steels. The tool was recognised by World Steel Association in 2023, winning a Steelie award \nfor Excellence in Life Cycle Assessment.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n179\n"

While India’s steel manufacturers rode on a strong \ndouble-digit demand in 2023, increase in imports in \nIndian market has resulted in excess supply of cheaper \nmaterial and impacted the prices.\n\t\n\u0007TSN and Tata Steel UK, along with other European steel \nproducers, are being squeezed between rising import \npressures and a long-term decline in demand.\n\t\n\u0007Fast paced technological changes and shifting customer \npreferences may necessitate adoption of newer grades \nof steel and/or alternate materials.\n\t\nMitigation Strategies\n\t\n\u0007In India, as Tata Steel sales are predominantly focused \non the domestic market, the Company targets the \nprice volatility by adjusting its sales mix geographically \nand across different segments. To mitigate the risk of \ncyclicality, long-term contracts are entered into with \ndiscerning customers (especially automotive segment) \nand by offering solutions.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel has invested in building a strong marketing \nfranchise with well-regarded brands and a large \nnetwork of distributors, dealers, and stocking points \nacross the country. Dedicated marketing and sales \nteams have nurtured strong customer relationships \nthrough tailored solutions, enhanced reliability, and  \nvalue-added products.\n\t\n\u0007The Company has specifically focused on green steel \nofferings in Netherlands and UK.\n\t\n\u0007The European Union is developing the Carbon Border \nAdjustment Mechanism (‘CBAM’) to put a fair price \non the carbon emitted during the production of  \ncarbon-intensive goods.

Non-adherence to such \nstringent regulatory ecosystem may impact business \noperations and reputation.\n\u0007Both Tata Steel Netherlands & Tata Steel UK are subject to \na wide range of regulations, with main concerns around \nthe implementation of CBAM and changes in energy and \nby-product legislation in Netherlands.

A focused \nstrategic approach is towards becoming the industry \nleader in CSR by creating long-lasting relations with \ncommunities in it’s operational areas. The various focused \nprograms are implemented through the Tata Steel \nFoundation in India. The Company implemented various \nprograms and collaborated with multiple platforms to \naddress the societal development challenges that has \nimpacted over 4.4 million lives directly in FY2023-24. \nOne of the key programs was community led-water \nconservation efforts yielding more than 100 million cubic \nfeet of recharge capacity in key watersheds.\nThe Company has also developed various programs \nto create change models in the ecosystem. The key \nprograms are highlighted as:\ni)\t\n\u0007Signature health program is a lifecycle approach to \nmaternal and child health and nutrition (MANSI+). \nIt covers the entire Kolhan division of Jharkhand. \nProject works in close coordination with frontline \nhealth workers (Sahiya) to ensure Institutional \ndelivery of identified high risk pregnant women \nthat has been 87.2% in FY2023-24.\nii)\t\n\u0007Signature program on education rolled out in \n37 blocks of Jharkhand and Odisha wherein the \nlearning model has been devised to provide \naccess to school for out of school children, learning \nsupport to overcome deficits, and governance for \nstrengthening the school management.\niii)\t\n\u0007Samvaad: Over 150 tribes across 24 states of the \ncountry have come together through dialogues \nand other engagement aimed at preserving tribal \nculture and practices\niv)\t\n\u0007Development Corridor program focus on \nstrengthening and functioning of the grassroots \ngovernance at 72 panchayats across the  \n272 km stretch of road that connects Tata Steel at \nJamshedpur and Kalinganagar.\nv)\t\n\u0007Embedding societal perspective in business \ndecisions: Tata Steel leverages its experience \nand capability in societal impact to build impact \necosystems, engaging partners for regions and \ncommunities that need deeper attention. The \nCompany also believes in the power of empathy \nwithin an organisation, and hence the need for senior \nofficers and frontline managers to be sensitised \ntowards key development challenges of the Dalit \nand tribal discourse. Accordingly, a social immersion \nprogram ‘Unurum’ was initiated and many senior, \nmiddle and entry level executives have undergone \nthis program. This was extended to sensitise future \nbusiness leaders from management school to \ndevelop deeper understanding of socio-economic \nrealities faced by the most vulnerable communities \nbecause of non-inclusive industrialisation.\nvi)\t\n\u0007Identification and engagement with key \nstakeholders: The Company convenes structured \nforums periodically to engage in dialogue with \ncommunities, facilitating co-creation of a shared \nimpact agenda and replicating successful processes \nin new locations.\nvii)\t \u0007Facilitating dialogue through social and traditional \nmedia. The Company  also implements a dedicated \nsocial media strategy that entails putting out \nground-up communities on the digital space for \nthe right voices to amplify its impact and engage \nwith a wider audience, facilitating dialogue and \nshare progress transparently.

Events \nlike the power crisis occurring every year puts stress \non the rake availability. In addition, railways accidents, \nregional strikes (e.g.: Kurmi strike in FY2023-24) add to \nthe uncertainty particularly in raw material circuit which \nis heavily dependent on railways for movement.\n\u0007There is now a constant risk of escalation of geo-political \ntensions, or any other black swan event impacting supply \nchain reliability and delivered cost due to increased ship/\ncontainer freights and lower container availability. The \nongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, Red Sea crisis are some \nsuch events that may pose risk to our Shipping operations \nand spend.

In the long-term, Tata \nSteel is working on commissioning a 7 MTPA slurry \npipeline from its iron ore mines to plant. In addition, \nprojects have been taken up to improve road \ninfrastructure in Kalinganagar and Meramandali for \nraw material movement.\n\t» \u0007Controlling Freight/logistics costs: Tata Steel has \nbeen able to maintain its shipping spend within the \nplan through continuous portfolio management and \nhedging initiatives.\n\t» Sustainability Initiatives: Supply Chain has \nstrengthened tracking and measurement of  \nScope 3 emissions and has proactively undertaken \nseveral initiatives for its commitment towards a greener \nsupply chain. Tata Steel has increased deployment of \nCNG/LNG/EV vehicles from 69 in FY2022-23 to 191 in \nFY2023-24 in its short lead circuit to reduce its CO2 \nfootprint from road movement. This is further being \nincreased to almost double the current number in \nFY2024-25. In FY2023-24, Tata Steel became the first \nIndian company to import cargo on Liquefied Natural \nGas (‘LNG’) fueled bulk carrier. 5 such shipments for \nimported raw materials were performed in FY2023-24 \nin addition to 22 biofuel-based shipments. More such \nshipments are in pipeline to be executed in coming \nyears using alternate fuels such as Biofuel, Ammonia, \nMethanol etc.\n\t\nInformation Security Risk:\n\u0007The Company’s operations significantly rely on IT and \ndigital infrastructure.

These commodities \nhave complex global supply chains and multiple factors such \nas continued geopolitical tensions, weather disruption, mining \nissues, upcoming elections, exchange rate movements,  \nsupply-demand imbalance, policy interventions by \ngovernments in key sourcing/consuming countries (especially \nChina), which serve as critical determinants of commodity \nmarket behaviour. These factors coupled with changes in \nmarket dynamics cause volatility in prices of raw materials \nthat has a bearing on the input costs of steel making. With \ndecarbonisation concerns, there is limited new investment \nin metallurgical coal. Therefore, an agile response to mitigate \nprice risk while maintaining a secure and stable supply chain \nis critical.\nThe changes in prices of commodities are balanced through \nadjustments in steel prices over a period which in effect act \nas a natural hedge to the business. However, there may be a \nlead and lag involved and hence several steps are being taken \nto manage the price volatility such as fixed price deals and \nmultiple pricing mechanism, diversified basket of suppliers, \nreduction through Value-in-use.\nThe Company meets 100% of its iron ore requirements in \nIndia, through its captive iron ore mines and about 22% \nof its coking coal requirements from its coal mines. These \ncaptive mines provide a structural hedge to the price \nrisk of these commodities. The Company has a dedicated \ncommodity sourcing team which engages with key raw \nmaterial producers across the globe and the commodity \nmarket at large to optimise sourcing. The team proactively \nundertakes the assessment of risks of single geography and \nproprietary sourcing. Several mitigations have been put in \nplace for diversified sourcing with focus on indigenisation as \none of the major levers to de-risk the supply chain for both \ndirect and indirect commodities which are dependent on \nimports. Coal sourcing is being diversified - such as sourcing \nbeing established from countries like Indonesia, USA, and \nCanada in addition to Australia and long-term tie-ups with \ncoal suppliers in Australia will keep prices competitive with an \nimproved reliability. This coupled with the trial of new grades \nof coals/use of weak coals with better Value-in-use will ensure \nthe availability of coal to meet the plant requirements and \nreduce the cost of sourcing.\nTata Steel, being an importer of coking coal, is exposed to \nrisk of volatility in coal prices. In view of continuous market \nfluctuations, predictive analytics tools have been leveraged \nto have an advance information on the price movement and \noptimise the timing of our spot buys through reverse auctions. \nThis has been integrated with the Company’s customised \ne-auction tool to mainly execute metallurgical coal spot \ntrades and better adjust Laycan timing of term cargoes. Price \nforecasting tools are also being used for commodities such as \nZinc, Aluminium, etc. to understand price movements and to \ntime the buy for optimising costs. Similarly, reverse auctions \nare being used for efficient price discovery for commodities \nsuch as ferroalloys, refractories, etc. Further, the Company is \nactively exploring new sources of Ferrous and Coal products \nwith a lower landed cost net of Value-in-use.\nRisk assessment for key vendors is also undertaken to assess the \ncapability of vendors in meeting the supply requirement. Tata \nSteel ensures that all suppliers mandatorily sign the Tata Business \nAssociate Code of Conduct during the vendor onboarding \nprocess. High risk vendors undergo an assessment for adherence \nto Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption (‘ABAC’) and Anti-Money \nLaundering (‘AML’) policies. Sustainable procurement policy \nhas been deployed to engage with suppliers/service providers \nto take initiatives in the areas of ‘reduce, recycle, and reuse’ and \nfoster responsible supply chain policy.\nGlobal steel demand was subdued in FY2023-24 as  \ngeo-political factors ensured sustained inflation, sliding \ncurrencies and supply disruptions and detours that also \nincreased freights. Russia’s war with Ukraine showed no signs \nof de-escalation however fresh trouble broke out in the form of \nIsrael-Hamas war and the more recent Red Sea crisis. Chinese \nsteel exporters aggressively sold across the world at highly \ncompetitive prices, impelled by dull home demand and the \nyuan’s depreciation. Steel prices fell more dynamically relative \nto raw materials in FY2023-24. Coking coal prices have been \nvolatile since Q2FY2023-24, thermal coal prices have remained \nmore range bound. However, Domestic steel consumption is \nexpected to moderate (7-8% in FY2024-25). Since additional \ncapacities are coming up in India, supply-side pressures \nwill be felt, and a supply-demand imbalance may emerge \nin the current fiscal. Domestic steel prices might continue \nto be under pressure if the external global macroeconomic \nenvironment remains subdued. The Company continuously \nrevisits the risks through analysis of multiple risk scenarios to \narrive at focused mitigation plans.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n319\n"

It could include having suitable accreditation (e.g., SA 8000:2014). If no suitable accreditation exists, a supplier must \nprovide evidence that their policies cover the key elements of SA8000:2014, including no forced labour in their operations. \nAny reported concerns are investigated thoroughly, and appropriate action taken following due process.\n\t\n\u0007No reports were received in respect of modern slavery or human trafficking in the supply chain during FY2023-24.

All complaints must be sent in writing and are \ndealt with in strict confidence by the IC members. After hearing both the parties, the IC thoroughly investigates \n(including meeting the aggrieved party, examining all evidence, meeting all witnesses, and consulting with experts) \nand makes a report of its findings for action. The Company also ensures that any employee/stakeholder involved in \nthe investigations is not victimised or subjected to any unfavourable treatment.\n\t\niii.\t\n\u0007Regular awareness and training sessions are conducted to ensure that the employees/stakeholders are fully aware of \nvarious aspects of sexual harassment and the redressal mechanism.\n\t\niv.\t\n\u0007Under the Whistle Blower Policy, complete protection is given to whistleblowers against any unfair practice, such as \nretaliation, threat, or intimidation of termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal \nof promotion, or the like, including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the whistleblower’s right to \ncontinue to perform his/her duties and functions, including making further disclosures.\n\t\nv.\t\n\u0007The Company take steps to minimise difficulties for the whistleblower because of making the disclosure. Thus, if the \nwhistleblower is required to give evidence in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Company arranges for the \nwhistleblower to receive advice about the procedure.\n\t\nvi.\t\n\u0007The identity of the whistleblower is kept confidential to the extent possible and permitted under law.\n\t\nvii.\t \u0007While TCoC discourages retaliation against anyone reporting any legitimate concern, the Whistle Blower policy \nalso provides for disciplinary action in case the complaint registered is found to be frivolous, false, or made with a \nmischievous intention.\n9.\t\nDo human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)\n\t\n\u0007Yes, human rights requirements form part of Tata Steel’s business agreements and contracts. The terms of a contract or \npurchase order copies submitted to vendors include compliance with SA8000:2014 requirements, and all vendor partners \nmust comply with such requirements. The SA8000:2014 policy covers various aspects of human rights such as child labour, \nforced or compulsory labour, health and safety, freedom of association, non-discrimination, disciplinary practices, security \npractices, working hours, compensation practices, supply chain practices and management systems.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel also follows the TCoC globally and expects all business associates and value chain partners to adhere to its \nprinciples. Specific clauses of the Tata Code of Conduct, including clauses on human rights, are included in all its business \nagreements and contracts/purchase orders.\n\t\n\u0007The Tata Code of Conduct can be accessed at https://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/our-organisation/ethics/. \nThe Business Associates Code of Conduct can be found at https://www.tatasteel.com/media/9244/business-associates-\ncode-of-conduct.pdf.\n\t\n\u0007Furthermore, Tata Steel’s Responsible Supply Chain Policy encourages supply chain partners to share the same \ncommitment. It expects them to integrate the four sustainability principles of Tata Steel (Fair business practices, Health \nand safety, Human Rights, and Environmental Management) in all their business decision-making, and extend them to \ntheir own supply chain.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n203\n"

      "text": "organisation. It is an important metric for governing all \nbusiness actions and strategic decisions.\n\t\nThe risk appetite is driven by the following:\n\t» Health and safety of the employees and the \ncommunities in which the Company operates are the \nprime concern and the operating strategy is focused \non the above objective.\n\t» All business decisions are aligned to the Tata Code \nof Conduct.\n\t» Management actions are focused on continuous \nimprovement.\n\t» Environment and Climate Change impacts are \nassessed on a continuous basis and business decisions \nsupport systems including capital allocation, \nconsiders climate impact through the internal carbon \npricing framework.\n\t» The long-term strategy of the Company is focused \non generating profitable growth and sustainable \ncashflows that creates long-term stakeholder value.\n\t\n\u0007Risk Owners may accept risk exposure to their annual and \nlong-term business plans, which after implementation \nof mitigation strategies, is aligned to the Company’s \nrisk appetite.\n\t\n\u0007In order to drive the ERM implementation, the Company \nhas also constituted a Management Committee called \nApex Risk Committee (‘ARC’) which comprises of \nthe Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director,  \n(‘CEO & MD’), Executive Director and Chief Financial \nOfficer (‘ED & CFO’) and Vice President – Corporate \nFinance, Treasury & Risk Management (‘VP CFT & RM’) as \nits members. The ARC reviews the business plan of ERM, \nengages on the macro environment and deliberates on \nthe risks that the Company faces, every quarter.\n\t\n\u0007The ERM framework is deeply embedded across the \norganisation and is driven by a dedicated Central ERM \nteam led by VP CFT & RM who acts as the Chief Risk \nOfficer ('CRO') of the Company. The CRO reports to \nED & CFO and also to the RMC Chairperson. The ERM \nteam continuously scans the external and internal \nenvironment for developments which may throw up \nemerging risks for the organisation. The risk flags and risk \ninsights are shared with the Senior Management for deep \ndiving into emerging risk areas for the Company. ‘Expert \nLens’ sessions are organised for the leadership team \nwhere external experts are invited to discuss emerging \nrisk areas contextual for the Company. Business Units \n(‘BUs’) consider these inputs during identification and \nmanagement of bottom-up risks, which are reviewed \nquarterly as per defined ERM Governance mechanism. \nThe bottom up ERM process is decentralised, and the \nownership of the risks resides with the BUs. Hence, \ncapability development for risk management remains \na focus area across the organisation. The bottom-up \nprocess is complemented by a top-down process, which \nhelps in identification of strategic enterprise level risks.\n\t\n\u0007The Company follows co-ordinated risk assurance \nand the ERM process is integrated with Corporate \nAudit, Corporate Strategy & Planning, Corporate Legal, \nCompliance and Security functions. The two-way \ncommunication with these functions brings further \nrigor in driving the process across the organisation and \nthe Tata Steel Group Companies (‘TSGCs'). Corporate \nAudit team, led by Chief Audit Executive (who reports to  \nCEO & MD of the Company and Chairperson of the Audit \nCommittee), conducts an independent audit of the ERM \nprocess deployment across the organisation, as the third \nline of defense. The ERM process being data intensive, \nan in-house built IT system has been deployed across \nthe organisation for management of risks through live \ndashboards. The IT system supports risk analytics and \nhelps in developing a uniform risk culture as the same \nERM framework is used while identifying, assessing, \nevaluating, monitoring and reviewing risks.\n\t\n\u0007The year has been disruptive for the global business \nenvironment, with the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, \nIsrael-Hamas conflict, attacks on the global trade route \nthrough Red Sea, to name a few. The Company remained \nvigilant of the evolving macroeconomic, geopolitical \nsituation and global financial market sentiments to \nproactively manage risks in FY2023-24. The focus on \nidentification and tracking of ‘Early Warning Indicators’  \nand implementation of risk mitigation strategies \nproactively has been a key enabler in managing these risks.\n\t\n\u0007The Company was conferred with the ‘RIMS ERM Global \nAward of Distinction 2023’ for 2nd consecutive year. The \naward recognises the Company’s outstanding ERM \nachievements that have enabled the organisation to \nstreamline processes and strengthen collaboration across \nthe enterprise in order to achieve strategic objectives.\n\t\n\u0007Risk Maturity Assessment was also conducted during the \nyear by an external agency. The assessment evaluated the \ndeployment of the ERM process across Tata Steel India. \nBased on the independent evaluation, the Company has \nreceived a score of 4.71 on a scale of 5 and assessed to be \nmuch ahead in the risk maturity curve as compared to its \npeers in the same industry.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n249\n"

Deeper \nintrospection on road safety practices, reaching beyond \nthe Company premises, systematically introducing \ntechnological interventions on roads and vehicles, \nand connecting with all the road pilots on one-to-one \nbasis has improved the risk perception and behavior. \nAdditionally, focused campaigns such as ‘Process \nSafety Alerts,’ Know Your PPE Series’, etc. to identify \nthe hazards and its risk mitigation by risk hierarchy of \ncontrol philosophy has reinforced safe behavior among \nCompany employees and contract employees. Tata Steel \nhas also launched the revisited ‘Life Saving Rules’ specific \nto nature of operation ranging from Mining, Operation \nand Maintenance, and Construction.\nWorkplace Safety and Process Safety Management \nin Tata Steel have matured over the years through \nadoption of various robotic and technological solutions \nto eliminate man-machine interface. Digital platforms \nhave been continuously enhanced to address and \nmitigate key concerns. In this regard, through its various \ncommand centres, Tata Steel leverages the CCTV \ninfrastructure to identify unsafe behavior and proactively \nprevent incidents.\nAt Tata Steel’s UK operation, a time-out for safety \ncampaign, which was rolled out across all employees \nand core contractors in the UK, continued throughout \nFY2023-24.

      "text": "T V Narendran\nChief Executive Officer & Managing Director\nKoushik Chatterjee\nExecutive Director & Chief Financial Officer\nEmpowering growth \nand progress\nQ  What were the challenges \nand highlights for the global \nsteel industry during the last \nfinancial year? \nDuring FY2023-24, the steel \nindustry faced an uneven global \nmacro-economic landscape. China’s \ntransition from investment-led growth \nto consumption-led growth contributed \nto a reduced demand for steel, as the \ncountry’s focus on heavy infrastructure \ninvestments seemed to taper. This was \nexacerbated by a sluggish real estate \nsector. The consequent overcapacity in \nChina and higher exports brought about \na downward pressure on global steel \nprices. The expansion of steelmaking \ncapacities in regional markets also \nintensified competition. Geopolitical \ntensions in Ukraine and the Middle East \ndisrupted traditional supply chains. Raw \nmaterial prices and other costs remained \nrelatively elevated even as steel prices \nsignificantly softened, putting pressure \non margins for steel producers.\nMeanwhile, steel companies around \nthe world, but especially in Europe \nand East Asia, have started to engage \nvery deeply and invest significantly in \nfinding solutions to reduce the carbon \nfootprint of the industry and increasing \ncircularity. These efforts are part of a \ntrend towards broad energy transition \nand decarbonisation, but there is no \none-size-fits-all solution. \nThe industry will need to continue \nto create bespoke solutions specific to \nindividual geographies, both in terms of \nnew technology solutions and ways to \noptimise costs of green steel. In addition, \nsuch efforts at least in the near to \nmedium-term will need to be supported \nby policy and public spending.\nQ  How was Tata Steel’s financial \nperformance in the backdrop of these \nglobal challenges?\nWhile the global steel demand \ngrowth moderated, India was a bright \nspot with strong demand from the \ninfrastructure and steel-intensive \nsectors. Tata Steel’s India operations \nwere able to leverage this, as the \nCompany achieved the highest-ever \ncrude steel production of ~20.8 MT \nand deliveries of ~19.9 MT. Domestic \ndeliveries were up 9% y-o-y.\nAmong the market segments, \nautomotive volumes were up 8% y-o-y. \nOur well-established retail brand in long \nproducts, Tata Tiscon, witnessed 15% \ny-o-y growth and crossed 2 MT in annual \nsales. The focus on improving product \nmix led to 6% y-o-y growth in high-end \nproduct sales.\nTata Steel's standalone revenues \nfor the full year were marginally lower \nat ₹1,40,987 crore, with an EBITDA of \n₹31,004 crore, reflecting an 8% y-o-y \nincrease, translating to an EBITDA margin \nof 22%. The reported PAT at ₹4,807 crore \nwas lower compared to ₹14,685 crore \nin the previous year, primarily due to an \nimpairment charge of ₹12,560 crore on \naccount of the proposed restructuring \nof operations and closure of our existing \nheavy end assets at Tata Steel UK.\nTata Steel’s consolidated revenues \nin FY2023-24 were at H2,29,171 crore \nand EBITDA was H23,402 crore, which \ntranslates to an EBITDA margin of \naround 10%. Capital expenditure was \nhigher 29% y-o-y at H18,207 crore \nduring the year driven by the phased \ncommissioning of the 5 MTPA expansion \nat Kalinganagar and the relining of \nBlast Furnace 6 at Tata Steel Nederland. \nNet debt stood at H77,550 crore, while \ngross debt was at H87,082 crore. Group \nliquidity remained strong at H31,767 \ncrore, which included cash and cash \nequivalents of H9,532 crore.\nTata Steel Nederland reported a \nreduction in deliveries and subdued \nannual revenues of £5,276 million with \nan EBITDA loss of £368 million primarily \ndue to an extended period of relining of \nBlast furnace 6. Liquid Steel production \nwas at 4.8 MT while deliveries stood \nat 5.33 MT.\nTata Steel UK reported annual \nrevenues of £2,706 million, with liquid \nsteel production at 2.99 MT and \ndeliveries of 2.80 MT. Tata Steel UK  \nreported an EBITDA loss of £364 \nmillion given the end-of-life condition \nof the heavy end assets, consequent \nproduction disruptions, and high fixed \nand maintenance costs.\nNINL Plant\nManagement Speak\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n26\n27\nOur Leadership\n"

      "text": "Q  Why were EBITDA and cash flow \nnegative for Tata Steel Nederland? \nWhat is the expectation for  \nFY2024-25?\nTata Steel Nederland recorded \nnegative EBITDA and cash flow due \nto operational and market issues \nduring FY2023-24. The relining of \nBlast Furnace 6 and its ramp up took \nlonger than anticipated, affecting \nthe production levels leading to \nsignificantly lower volumes, higher \nfixed costs and higher costs of \nmaintenance, spares and capex. \nAdditionally, while steel prices fell, \nraw materials and other costs were \nrelatively high in the region, putting \npressure on margins.\nHowever, Blast Furnace 6 is back \nto full production at the close of the \nyear, and in FY2024-25 we expect \nTata Steel Nederland to produce \nsteel commensurate with its rated \ncapacity, resulting in better fixed \ncost absorption and more efficient \noperations. As production volumes \nstabilise and improve along with \nimprovements in material and \nconversion costs, it will result in \nimproved EBITDA margins and cash \nflows for the coming year.\nQ  What are the plans for \nrestructuring and transitioning \nto EAF-based steelmaking at  \nTata Steel UK? \nAs we have previously stated, \nthe current heavy end assets of Port \nTalbot are nearing their end of life, \nare operationally unstable and are \nresulting in unsustainable financial \nlosses. Tata Steel UK will close its Blast \nFurnaces 5 and 4 by the end of June \nand September 2024, respectively. \nThe coke ovens were closed in \nMarch 2024, as operations became \nunviable. In April 2024, the Company \ncompleted an exhaustive 7-month \nprocess of national-level formal and \ninformal consultations on all options \nwith the Unions and concluded that \nthe multi-union plan which involved \ncontinuity of Blast Furnace 4 through \nthe transition is not technically, \noperationally or financially viable. To \nmitigate the impact of the announced \nrestructuring, a generous voluntary \nredundancy programme has been \ndeveloped and is being offered \nto the impacted employees. The \nrestructuring costs associated with this \nexercise will be phased over a period of \n18 months.\nIn September 2023, Tata Steel \nreached an agreement with the UK \ngovernment to jointly invest £1.25 \nbillion (including a £500 million \nUK government grant), the largest \ninvestment in many decades in British \nsteelmaking, in a new electric arc \nfurnace (EAF) project which would \nensure future continuity of steelmaking \nat Port Talbot. The project will reduce \ndirect emissions of CO₂ from the \nsteel works by 50 MT over 10 years \nand utilise locally available scrap in \nthe UK. Tata Steel is at an advanced \nstage of engineering and plans to \nplace equipment orders for the \nEAF by September 2024 and begin \nconstruction by August 2025.\nUntil the commissioning of the EAF \nin 2027, the Hot Strip Mill operations \nand downstream units in the UK will \nbe supported by import of slabs and \nhot-rolled coils from Tata Steel’s own \noperations in India and the Netherlands \nas well as other suppliers. Tata Steel UK \nhas put in place solutions for logistics \nfor the transition period and executed \na power connection agreement which \nwill ensure the necessary high-voltage \npower for the electric arc furnace in line \nwith the project plan.\nQ  What are your decarbonisation \nplans for Tata Steel Nederland?\nWe are in discussions with the \nDutch government for a financial \nand policy-level support on a \ndecarbonisation plan to replace one \nof the two blast furnaces with a Direct \nReduced Iron (DRI) plant and an EAF \nbefore 2030. On March 28, 2024, the \nDutch cabinet confirmed that the \ngovernment is willing to support \nthe proposal from Tata Steel and has \ngiven a mandate to the government to \nnegotiate the same.\nThe Dutch government intends to \nreach a binding agreement with Tata \nSteel by the end of the present fiscal \nyear, after approval from the Dutch \nparliament and the Tata Steel Board. \nThe government has commenced due \ndiligence on the proposal's financial, \ncommercial, and technical aspects. \nThis will be followed by detailed \ndiscussions over the next several \nmonths. \nQ  What were the commissioning \nactivities undertaken at \nKalinganagar during the year? What \nare Tata Steel’s plans for future \nexpansion there?\nWe continued the phased \ncommissioning of the 5 MTPA capacity \nexpansion at Kalinganagar during the \nyear. We started the 2.2 MTPA Cold \nRolling Mill which has enhanced our \nproduct mix. The commissioning of \nthe 6 MTPA Pellet Plant significantly \nreduced the Company’s dependence \non external purchases, contributing \nto better cost management and \noperational efficiency. Stove heating \nwas initiated, and power was charged \ninto the new blast furnace which \nis expected to start production by \nSeptember 2024. We also started the \nchimney heating for coke ovens.\nAs stated previously, Tata Steel is \nfocused on investing in value accretive \ngrowth in India, which is an attractive \nmarket with increasing demand for \nsteel. We are building a 0.75 MTPA \nelectric arc furnace based steel plant in \nLudhiana, Punjab, India. At Neelachal \nIspat Nigam Limited, which was \nacquired through the Government \nof India’s DIPAM programme, we \nexpect to increase the capacity from \n1 MTPA to 5.5 MTPA in the first phase. \nWe also expect to increase the Tata \nSteel Kalinganagar’s capacity in \nthe 3rd phase (after completion of \nthe current phase) from 8 MTPA to \n13 MTPA. We are exploring plans to \nincrease capacity at our Meramandali \noperations as well. Finally, we are also \nlooking to enhance our downstream \ncapabilities and related businesses.\nQ  What is the status of the \namalgamation of business entities \nannounced in FY2022-23?\nAs of March 2024, five strategic \nbusiness entities were successfully \nmerged into Tata Steel following the \ncompletion of regulatory procedures. \nThis consolidation marks a pivotal \nstep towards fortifying our position in \nvalue-added segments by leveraging \nour marketing and sales network \nacross product lines. We are also \naccruing various benefits through \nsynergies on raw materials, centralised \nprocurement, inventory optimisation, \nTowards Net Zero by 2045\nBlast Furnace 6 at IJmuiden Plant, Tata Steel Nederland\nIn September 2023, Tata Steel \nreached an agreement with \nthe UK government to jointly \ninvest £1.25 billion, the largest \ninvestment in many decades \nin British steelmaking, in \na new electric arc furnace \nproject which would \nensure future continuity of \nsteelmaking at Port Talbot.\nManagement Speak\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n28\n29\nOur Leadership\n"

While EU demonstrated \nresilience through the recent energy crisis, high interest \nrates and energy costs continue to impact manufacturing. \nThe downside factors pulled the demand in 2023 to \nlowest since 2000. The demand in 2024 is expected to \nbe just over the pandemic levels.\n\t\nDemand Outlook\n\t\n\u0007Global Steel demand is expected to grow by ~2% to reach \n1,793 MT in 2024. Chinese domestic demand will continue \nto be impacted by property sector woes, however, \nGovernment impetus may improve infrastructure \ninvestment in later part of 2024 and domestic demand \nis expected to sustain 2023 level. Exports are expected \nto continue to be at 2023 levels. Consolidation in the \nsector may improve profitability of Chinese mills in the \nlong run but squeeze margins during investment phase. \nIn 2024, Chinese steel demand is expected to sustain at \n2023 level. However, it is likely to decline in the medium-\nterm, as China gradually moves away from a real estate \nand infrastructure investment dependent economic \ndevelopment model.\n\t\n\u0007The developed world is also expected to show a \nstrengthening recovery with 1.3% in 2024 and 2.7% in \n2025, as it is expected to see steel demand finally show \na meaningful uptick in the EU in 2025 and continued \nresilience in the US, Japan, and Korea.\n\t\n\u0007Emerging regions like Middle East and North Africa \n(‘MENA’) and Association of Southeast Asian Nation \n(‘ASEAN’) are expected to show accelerating growth \nin their steel demand over 2024-2025 after a significant \nslowdown over 2022-2023. Political instability and \nerosion of competitiveness may lead to a lower trend \nsteel demand growth going ahead.\n\t\n\u0007India has emerged as the strongest driver of steel demand \ngrowth since 2021. The growth is backed by a booming \nconstruction sector with private consumption as well as \nrobust Government expenditure fuelling infrastructure \nand capital goods as well. Automotive also performed \nbetter than expected while consumer durables industry \nunderperformed in the inflationary environment. Coking \ncoal prices softened towards the end of the financial year \nand imports from China squeezed margins for domestic \nplayers while pulling down international steel prices.\n\t\n\u0007The growth projection for India’s GDP in the FY2024-25 \nis expected to be 6.8% reflecting both global and \ndomestic optimism in the Country’s economy on the \nback of robust manufacturing activity and infrastructure \nspending. India is expected to retain its tag of the fastest \ngrowing large economy.\n\t\n\u0007While private industrial capital spending in India has been \nslow, it is expected to pick up with ongoing supply chain \ndiversification benefits and investors response to the \nGovernment’s PLI scheme to boost key manufacturing \nindustries. Additionally, rising capacity utilisation, robust \ncredit growth and upbeat business sentiment point to an \nimproving outlook for private investment.\n\t\n\u0007The Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep interest \nrates constant in the near term, while restrained public \nconsumption spending is expected to be offset by strong \npublic investment expenditures.\n\t\n\u0007For the next fiscal, inflation is expected to decline \nfurther on an average amid risks to food inflation. Soft \ncommodity prices and healthier farm output should help \nmoderate inflation. However, geopolitical disruption in \nthe Middle East could add some pressure on inflation.\n\t\n\u0007Softer crude oil prices and moderation in domestic \ngrowth is expected to keep trade deficit in check despite \ntepid export of goods. Alongside, robust services trade \nsurplus and healthy remittances is expected to keep \nthe CAD in check which coupled with healthy foreign \nportfolio flows amid a favourable domestic macro \nenvironment would support the Indian Rupee.\n\t\n\u0007Steel demand in India is expected to grow at ~8% in 2024 \nto reach 144 million tonnes. Interim budget has signaled \nstrong demand with 11% increase in infrastructure \nbudget. Steel demand growth is expected to continue, \nalbeit slightly subdued in the first half of the year due \nto slowdown of construction during general elections. \nPrices are expected to remain soft in light of cheaper \nChinese imports in absence of policy intervention. \nIntegrated steel plants are expected to continue capacity \nadditions, although at a slower pace than announced \ngiven tough operating environment.

Since then, central banks \nhave maintained rates, anticipating that the effects of \nthe rate hikes implemented throughout 2023 will sustain \nprogress with respect to inflation dynamics.\n\t\n\u0007In India, RBI maintained the policy repo rate at 6.5%, \nunchanged during the financial year (FY2023-24). The \nlast increase was in February 2023. RBI continues to \nremain focused on maintaining CPI inflation at 4% in the \nmedium-term, with a tolerance range of plus or minus \n2%, while also promoting economic growth.\n\t\nFinancing:\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel triangulates its capital allocation between \ndeleveraging, return to shareholders and growth \ncapex to provide optimal returns to the shareholders \nand our strategy is calibrated to evolving operating \ncycles. For instance, in FY2020-21 and FY2021-22, \nTata Steel successfully deleveraged our gross debt by  \nH40,767 crore and this was much higher than the \nCompany’s annual deleveraging target of $1 billion. \nDuring these years, the focus was on strengthening the \nbalance sheet of the Company and positioning to aid \nfuture growth. Subsequently, in FY2022-23 and FY2023-\n24, Tata Steel has prioritised growth capital expenditure \nespecially for Kalinganagar. This along with volatile \noperating environment that led to higher working capital \nrequirements and outflows for acquistion of NINL and \ndividend have meant that our gross debt increased from \nH75,561 crore in FY2021-22 to around H88,230 crore in \nFY2023-24. On an annual basis, gross debt has witnessed \nonly a marginal increase between FY2022-23 to  \nFY2023-24 despite the volatile operating environment.\n\t\n\u0007The phased commissioning of 2.2 MTPA Cold Rolling \nmill complex and operations of pellet plant in \nKalinganagar have already begun during 2024. The \nCompany looks forward to commissioning of 5 MTPA \nblast furnace which is expected to aid cashflows as well \nas credit metrices.

The grievance mechanisms are designed based \non location specific requirements, so as to be most effective.\nTata Steel Foundation (TSF), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel Limited, is responsible for driving community engagement \nprocesses in the operational areas of Tata Steel Limited in India. It involves regular interactions with the community, sub-\ngroups, and local stakeholders to address and resolve grievances. TSF has implemented initiatives in over 5,000 villages across \nJharkhand and Odisha, impacting over 4 million lives in FY2023-24. It has a team of over 1,400 people working on impact-\ndriven initiatives that focus on developing tribal and excluded communities with a process of co-creation. These initiatives \nare change models that can be replicated at regional and national scales. TSF embeds societal perspectives in key business \nprocesses to create value and long-term social capital.\nTSF has created a grievance redressal ecosystem that facilitates input from communities in and around Tata Steel Limited’s \nsites. This ecosystem ensures real-time information flow concerning Tata Steel’s Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. \nIt enables issues to emerge before they even reach the grievance stage requiring redressal. The ecosystem consists of  \nthe following:\n1.\t\n\u0007The contact numbers and names of Unit Heads and Key Personnel are prominently displayed in all TSF offices and in \nvarious publicly accessible places. This has resulted in the easy and immediate approachability of TSF’s senior leadership \nto anyone from the community. The TSF leadership team receives regular feedback regarding TSF’s work on the ground, \nensuring corrective action is taken in advance and concerns are addressed.\n2.\t\n\u0007TSF offices across various regions are accessible to the local communities and stakeholders who frequently visit the team \nto discuss their issues. In these meetings, community members’ concerns are addressed at length, and their feedback on \nthe work done by TSF is considered. This feedback is a valuable source of continuous learning that enables the team to \nidentify lessons and prevent the recurrence of similar grievances in the future. By understanding the dynamic ecosystem \nwell, the team can adapt and implement initiatives, prioritising them based on the list of addressed gaps.\n3.\t\n\u0007Tata Steel Limited has established forums that involve the participation of community representatives and citizens. These \nforums are designed to follow a participatory approach rather than a formal grievance redressal system. This approach \nensures a free flow of input and enables understanding of different perspectives and concerns. Hence, these forums \nhelp to create a deep two-way relationship between the Company and the communities. Some of the key forums are:\n\t\na)\t\nScheduled Tribe Stakeholder’s Council\n\t\nb)\t\nScheduled Caste Stakeholder’s Council\n\t\nc)\t\nCitizens’ Forum of Jamshedpur\nTSF deeply engages with communities and Panchayats to implement Tata Steel’s CSR initiatives. This involves continuous \ninteractions and feedback to the TSF team. Local recruits act as a bridge between the Company and communities, addressing \ngrievances promptly and comprehensively.\nTSF teams have an in-built mechanism where the field staff, programme team, and unit heads regularly communicate with \nindividuals and groups within the communities and other stakeholders. This ensures that any grievances are brought to the \nattention of senior management. Additionally, the mechanism is supported by regular interactions between the communities \nand other stakeholders, the thematic and geographic heads of TSF and the TSF leadership team.\nTSF team members conduct interactive sessions during visits to listen to complaints and provide assistance. They identify \ncomplaint-prone areas, study them, and implement remedial measures. Outcome monitoring is carried out to ensure timely \nand strategic grievance redressal.\nPublic hearings are crucial in obtaining environmental clearance for projects. The Company conducts public hearings \nregularly to listen to community concerns. Based on feedback, it takes up projects as commitments to address issues raised \nby stakeholders and communities.\nSimilarly, Tata Steel has intensified communication with the community in the Netherlands to address concerns among \nresidents and employees who often live nearby. Employees from neighbourhood towns often receive many questions from \ntheir community. Tata Steel regularly updates its employees so that they can, in turn, update their respective communities.\nResidents affected by disturbances from the Company’s operations in IJmuiden can report them to Tata Steel through \nmultiple channels, including the information desk in Wijk aan Zee, by phone, or by using a complaint form on the Tata Steel \nNederland’s website. All complaints are investigated. The Company aims to trace the possible source of disturbance promptly \nand specifically on the premises and take necessary measures as quickly as possible. \nBased on various data measurements and complaints, processes are improved wherever feasible. For instance, it has been \nobserved that noise disturbances are primarily associated with incidents such as impacts and collisions, as well as annoying \nsounds like whistling, humming, and buzzing. To determine possible noise sources, the Company has installed, for example, \nsound meters on cranes involved in scrap processing. When it comes to measures to reduce noise, it investigates the possibility \nof building dampers in certain installations.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n158\nStatutory Reports\n"

In FY2023-24, the ‘Wellness for Life’ portal was launched. This initiative \nincludes the introduction of two apps, ‘Wellspring’ and ‘The Wellness Corner’, accessible through the portal. These apps \nserve as a comprehensive platform for employees to assess, monitor, and improve their health.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel has also partnered with an external agency to provide counselling services to employees and their families for \ntheir mental well-being. Tata Steel employees in India are eligible for a periodic executive health check-up.\n\t\n\u0007In the Netherlands, Tata Steel is implementing a health roadmap, with the vision: ‘We work in optimal conditions to be able \nto live and work in a healthy and vital way’. This shared vision emphasises the importance of sustainable employability and \npreventive sickness absence. Preventing exposure to hazardous substances and conditions is one of the top priorities for \nthe avoidance of occupational diseases. The chance that employees may experience extreme temperatures is inherent \nin steelmaking. To remove the risk, the Company is working on an app that employees can use to manage their ‘heat \nstress’. Further efforts include a campaign to draw employees’ attention to the importance of respiratory protection in \nspecific situations.\n\t\n\u0007In the UK, Tata Steel is committed to promoting, protecting, and maintaining the mental health and well-being of all \nemployees through workplace practices by reducing the stigma around mental health and encouraging all employees \nto take proactive steps for their own well-being. Tata Steel UK has deployed a mental health policy and created new \nsupporting resources and training for our Mental Health First Aiders (MHFA) who act as a point of contact for employees \nexperiencing emotional distress or suffering in silence with mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety or depression. \n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n182\nStatutory Reports\n"

Specifically for workers, different policies are in place for various Tata Steel Group entities based on local \nmarket practices. Performance and career development reviews assess the skill level of each worker, which is essential \nin their career progression and development. Such reviews are at an individual level at some locations, and team-based \nperformance review mechanisms are in place at other locations (e.g., Incentive Bonus schemes, Team Performance Rewards, \nIron Ore Sufficiency Rewards, Coal Production Enhancement Rewards, etc.). The annual bonus scheme for Permanent \nWorkers depends on their performance across productivity, profitability, and safety parameters.\n10.\t Health and safety management system:\n\t\na.\t\n\u0007Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/\nNo). If yes, the coverage of such system?\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Yes, Tata Steel has implemented an occupational health and safety management system. The system is based on  \nISO 45001:2018 and is designed to ensure that the Company meets EHSMS (Environmental, Health, and Safety \nManagement System) related legal obligations and provides a safe and healthy working environment for its employees. \nSafety and Health Management are integrated into the Company’s annual business planning process and cascaded \ndown from the Apex level to divisional and departmental levels to ensure employee health and safety and place \naccountability and responsibility at all levels.\n\t\nb.\t\n\u0007What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine \nbasis by the entity?\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel places the highest emphasis on employee health and safety. The Company has introduced a recalibrated \nRisk Matrix to improve its hazard identification and risk assessment process. It has implemented an Environment, \nHealth and Safety (EHS) Risk Management framework to assess risks associated with all activities. The framework also \ncaptures the top organisational risks related to EHS and outlines strategies to address them.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel’s commitment to safety is demonstrated through its continuous efforts to strengthen its safety culture and \nreduce risks through strategic interventions. The Company employs several proactive safety tools and measures to \nensure a safe working environment for its employees. These include:\n\t\n\t\n1.\t\n\u0007Safety Visits and Line Walks, involving regular workplace inspections to identify potential unsafe acts and \nconditions by all levels of Company employees.\n\t\n\t\n2.\t\n\u0007Elimination of Commonly Accepted Unsafe Practices targets unsafe practices that are commonly accepted but \npose a risk to employees’ safety.\n\t\n\t\n3.\t\n\u0007The Fatality Risk Control Programme is another proactive tool for identifying potential risks that could lead \nto fatalities.\n\t\n\t\n4.\t\n\u0007Job Cycle Checks is a tool for checking the compliance and adequacy of Standard Operating Procedures for a \nparticular job. It involves reviewing each stage of a job while getting performed at the workplace.\n\t\n\t\nDigital interventions for safety:\n\t\n\t\ni.\t\n\u0007Tata Steel’s Connected Workforce platform uses a plant-wide heat map that assigns a colour code to microzones \ninside the works. By using electronic work permit data, training data, skill data, etc., coupled with near real-time \nimage analytics, the system delivers a continuous risk assessment of person, place, process, and asset.\n\t\n\t\nii.\t\n\u0007As part of its business responsibility of ensuring a safe work environment and improving safety and health at \nworkplace, far-site Integrated Remote Operation Centre (iRoC) has been established for Agglomerates (8 iSPOC \nfor Sinter Plant and Pellet Plant Operations), Raw Materials (14 iRMSC for Remote Supervision of 5 raw material \nlocations) operations, Coke Plant (the newly inaugurated iCPROC at Jamshedpur) and the Integrated Maintenance \nExcellence Centre (iMEC) is TSL’s innovation hub, offering real-time, advanced maintenance advice to shop \nfloors to reduce the physical human footprint at the hazardous shop floor location and provide ergonomic and \ncomfortable environment to employees compared to near location control rooms. It has the added benefit of \nreducing the carbon footprint of operators travelling to remote plant and raw material locations, making them \nmore sustainable.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n188\nStatutory Reports\n"

Towards this, the Company has undertaken \nprioritised set of initiatives for environmental protection \nby addressing environmental concerns associated with \nits operations and supply chain. The Safety, Health and \nEnvironment Committee of the Board provides oversight \nand necessary guidance on the environmental matters. \nThe Company has identified internal teams to take care of \nenvironmental requirements and issues at its operating \nlocations, globally. As part of responsible advocacy, the \nCompany syndicates its stance with key stakeholders \non environmental policy matters including regulatory \nissues and actively participates in various national and \ninternational initiatives on diverse issues.\n\t\n\u0007Guided by the Tata Code of Conduct, Climate change \npolicy for Tata companies, Tata Steel’s corporate policies \n(environmental policy, energy policy, biodiversity \npolicy), the Company endeavours to set steel industry \nbenchmark in environmental performance. The Company \nhas achieved significant reduction in its environment \nfootprint over the years through process optimisation, \nasset upgradation and efficiency enhancement to realise \nits commitment as a responsible stakeholder in the \ncommunity. Towards this, the Company has undertaken \nseveral initiatives in areas of resource conservation, \npollution control and waste management, amongst \nothers. The Company has adopted environment \nfriendly processes, best available technologies,  \nreal-time monitoring systems and has IT enabled  \nreal-time dashboards to facilitate environmentally \nfriendly operational control. The Company has \ndigitised the systems of real-time monitoring of \nenvironmental parameters for faster identification of \nprobable environmental impacts of its operations to \ninitiate mitigating actions for controling environmental \npollution. The Company maintains transparency of its \nenvironmental performance through various disclosures \nto stakeholders from time to time. During the year under \nreview, the Company has taken initiatives to retain \nIndian benchmark position of Jamshedpur Steel Works \nin specific stack dust emissions and specific fresh-water \nintake amongst coal-based Blast Furnace – Basic Oxygen \nFurnace (BF-BOF) plants.\n\t\n\u0007In the UK, Tata Steel achieved a re-certification of the \nenvironmental management system at its main sites \nto ISO 14001: 2015 and secured ongoing certification \nof its products to the BES6001 sustainability standard. \nDespite the Company’s efforts, it noted an increase in \nthe number of complaints received from members \nof the public during FY2022-23 and the early part of  \nFY2023-24, specifically regarding concerns about odour, \nnoise, and dust. These concerns arose primarily in \nrelation to issues related to the stability of the two blast \nfurnaces at Port Talbot. In response to the complaints, \nthe Company examined its processes and operations \nto ensure it was taking all necessary steps to meet and \ngo beyond regulatory requirements. In recognition of \nthe value it places on the feedback received from the \nlocal community, it initiated a review of its complaint \nmanagement process to ensure timely and effective \nresolution of issues raised by the public. This led to \nthe implementation of a revised, improved process. By \nfostering open lines of communication, the Company \naims to strengthen its relationship with the community \nand address their environmental concerns more \neffectively. The Company always has, and always will, \ndeeply value the well-being and prosperity of everyone \nwho forms a part of the communities in which it operates. \nIts commitment to reducing the environmental impact of \nits operations remains resolute.\n\t\n\u0007During the year, TSN further accelerated the measures \nunder the Roadmap+ programme by implementing \nmeasures to reduce dust, noise, odour and other \nemissions. In January 2024, TSN commissioned its largest \nenvironmental installation, a dedusting installation at its \nIJmuiden Pellet Plant. The dedusting plant is to reduce \nemissions of lead by 70%, alongside reduction in dust. \nIt will be accompanied with a nitrogen oxide reduction \n(deNOx), which is expected to be operational in 2025. \nTata Steel is also building windbreaker screens of about \n18 metres height and around a kilometre length around \nthe raw material storage facilities, thereby reducing wind \nspeeds and the associated dust dispersal. Local artist \nand residents have been encouraged to participate in \nthe design. The windbreaker will be finished in the \nsecond half of 2024. As part of its transition to low CO2 \nsteelmaking, and its discussions with the government \nregarding state support, TSN has also announced \nenvironmental measures to include in the transition plan, \nmainly focussing on reduction of fine dust.\n2.\t\nClimate Change\n\t\n\u0007Climate change is one of the most pressing issues \nthe world faces today, and the Company recognises \nits obligation to work towards mitigation of climate \nchange related risks and strives to reduce its carbon \nfootprint especially of steelmaking facilities across all  \ngeographies.

      "text": "a competitive regulatory environment. \nThe agreement between Tata Steel \nand the UK Government to co-invest \nin the transition to EAF steelmaking at \nPort Talbot represents a milestone in \njoint decarbonisation efforts by a steel \ncompany and national Government.\nThe Netherlands\nTata Steel's steel manufacturing \nplant at IJmuiden, in the Netherlands, \nhas two blast furnaces with a \nsteelmaking capacity of 7 MTPA. \nThrough consistent energy efficiency \nand process improvements since 1990, \nthe plant has reduced approximately \n15% of its CO2 emissions per tonne \nof steel. With its CO2 intensity being \n7% lower than the European average, \nthe IJmuiden plant is one of the most \nCO2 efficient steel plants in the world \n(among the top three as per the World \nSteel Association benchmark).\nTata Steel has made a public \ncommitment in the Netherlands to \nreduce its CO2 emissions by 5 MT \nby 2030 through an accelerated \ntransition process. \nIn November 2023, Tata Steel \npresented the updated Green Steel \nPlan to the government, covering the \nfollowing three key objectives: \nClean: In the Netherlands, Tata \nSteel intends to prioritise reducing \nparticulate matter and nitrogen \ndioxides. In addition to measures \nalready being taken to reduce \nparticulate matter, the Green Steel \nPlan contains non-statutory measures \nto cover raw material storage. \nThese canopies prevent the drift of \nfine and coarse dust. Tata Steel is \nalready implementing measures to \nreduce nitrogen oxide emissions, \nsuch as constructing a large DeNOx \ninstallation at the Pellet Factory, which \nwill be operational in 2025, reducing \nNOx emissions by around 80% versus \nits 2019 baseline. \nGreen: From 2030 onwards, Tata \nSteel Nederland intends to reduce its \nCO2 emissions by 5 MT, annually. To \nachieve this, the Company plans to \nreplace Blast Furnace 7 and Coking \nand Gas Plant 2 (to be closed by 2029) \nwith a Direct Reduced Iron Plant \n(DRP) combined with an electric arc \nfurnace. The DRP will initially run \non natural gas. As cost-competitive \nhydrogen becomes available in \nsufficient quantity, the plant would \nbe able to run on hydrogen without \nany modification. The iron from this \nDRP will be used in the EAF and \nsupplemented with scrap in a much \nlarger quantity than currently used in \nthe IJmuiden plant.\nCircular: By 2030, the Company \nplans to increase the use of scrap in the \nIJmuiden plant to approximately 30% \nof total annual production. Thus, it will \nbecome less dependent on primary \nraw materials and more supportive of \nthe circular economy principles.\nThe Green Steel Plan is a significant \nmove towards reducing environmental \nand climate impact as quickly as \npossible. It will probably be the most \nprominent industrial transition in the \nNetherlands in the coming years. Tata \nSteel is discussing the Green Steel \nPlan with the Ministry of Economic \nAffairs, the province of North Holland, \nand simultaneously engaging with \nsuppliers, customers, the local \ncommunity, and other stakeholders.\nThe Green Steel Plan entails \nsignificant investment by Tata Steel \nand can succeed only with policy \nand financial support from the \ngovernment. With the submission \nof the plan, a new phase has begun \nin the discussion between Tata Steel \nand the Dutch government, and both \nparties will continue to discuss and \nnegotiate to reach a final agreement \nfor its implementation.\nTata Steel has introduced \nZeremis® Carbon Lite – steel with an \nallocated carbon footprint reduction \nof up to 90%, gaining traction among \ncustomers in various industries, \nincluding automotive, construction, \nand new mobility sectors. Tata Steel \nhas signed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MoU) with Snop and \nGedia for the long-term steel supply \nwith a lower environmental footprint. \nInitially, Tata Steel intends to provide \nGedia with Zeremis® Carbon Lite steel, \nwith an allocated carbon footprint \nreduction of up to 90%. Tata Steel will \nprovide Zeremis®-embodied green \nsteel when the IJmuiden steelworks \nadopts its new steelmaking route.\nTata Steel has also launched \nZeremis® Delivered, which allows \ncustomers to receive their steel \norders through lower-emission \ntransportation methods. The service \nenables customers to reduce their \nScope 3 emissions and other emissions \nlinked to the transportation of steel. \nUnder the Zeremis® Delivered brand, \nthe Company has introduced a broad \nrange of zero-emission logistics \nsolutions across modalities such \nas battery electrification and fuel \ncell technologies.\nTata Steel has signed an agreement \nwith Swedish metal company Boliden \nto procure low-carbon zinc, which has \none of the lowest CO2 footprints of \nany refined zinc globally. According to \nBoliden, the supplied zinc emits less \nthan 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of zinc, \ncompared to the industry average \nof 3.6 tonnes.\nTata Steel has also completed over \nthirty environmental investments \nfrom the Roadmap Plus programme \nto reduce air emissions, including \ndust and noise pollution at IJmuiden. \nFor example, three new dedusting \ninstallations were implemented in \nIJmuiden at the beginning of 2024. In \nthe Pellet Plant at IJmuiden, a dust-\nremoval installation was fitted. With \nthis expansion, Tata Steel expects \nto reduce emissions of particulate \nmatter, lead and other heavy metals by \napproximately 80% at the Pellet Plant.\nIn February 2024, Tata Steel \nstarted two major projects \nas part of the Roadmap Plus \nimprovement programme:\n\t»\nDeNOx installation at \nthe pellet plant will capture \nNOx compounds and reduce \nnitrogen oxide emissions by \n80% versus a 2019 baseline. \n\t»\nAn 18-metre high and \n1,000-metre long windbreaker \nto reduce dust emissions from \nraw material storage.\nTata Steel Nederland has also \ncompleted the pilot project, which \nmakes use of E-Liability carbon \naccounting methodology.\nThe United Kingdom \nOn September 15, 2023, Tata Steel \nannounced that it had reached an \nagreement with the UK government \non proposals that would see the two \nblast furnaces at Port Talbot replaced \nwith an electric arc furnace (EAF). The \nEAF and associated investments will \ncost £1.25 billion. The UK government \nwill pay £500 million, and Tata Steel \nwill fund the balance. To be able \nto deliver the proposed electric \narc furnace by 2027, Tata Steel has \nbegun engineering design work and \nconstruction planning for a furnace \nthat would be among the most \nmodern in the world.\nThe project will bolster the UK's \nsteel security and be the first leap \ntowards decarbonising the UK steel \nindustry, potentially reducing direct \ncarbon emissions by 5 MTPA, a \n90% reduction in direct emissions. \nIt will also be transformational \nregarding the UK's progress towards \na more circular economy, leveraging \ndomestically available scrap steel and \npromoting value addition.\nSubsequently, after seven months \nof formal and informal national-level \ndiscussions with the UK trade unions, \nTata Steel has announced its decision \nto proceed with closure of the existing \nheavy-end assets. The two Blast \nFurnaces, No.5 and No.4, at Port Talbot \nwill close by the end of June 2024 \nand September 2024, respectively. \nFollowing the closure of Blast Furnace \nNo.4, the remaining heavy-end assets \nwill wind down.  \nDuring the transition period \nand project phase, Tata Steel will \nensure uninterrupted and reliable \nproduct supply to fulfil customer and \nmarket commitments, through the \nimport of hot rolled coil and slabs \nfrom stable and responsible supply \nchains, including its plants in India \nand the Netherlands, to feed its \ndownstream units. \nTata Steel has already progressed \nthe EAF investment programme \nto an advanced engineering stage \nand expects to place equipment \norders by September 2024. Based \non current timelines, construction \non the project will begin by August \n2025.

This reagent through reverse iron ore flotation \ncan lower alumina level from 5% in the feed to 3% in the product \nwith concentrate yield of 75%.\nThe pilot plant trial using the said reagent \nis in progress.\nOily bubble flotation to \nimprove fine clean yield at \ncoal washery\nTo improve the fine, clean coal yield in the coal washery, Tata Steel \nhas developed a new technology wherein the air bubble in the \nflotation circuit gets coated with a thin layer of oil. This localised \npresence of oil at the bubble interface lowers the energy barrier \nrequired for the three-phase attachment of the bubble with the \nparticle and increases the hydrophobicity of the bubble.\nWith successful lab and pilot-scale trials, \nthe process is now being tested at the \nplant scale.\nThermal Hawk: A One Stop \nSolution for Real-Time \nVisualisation inside the Blast \nFurnace\nThermal Hawk is a thermal sensor-based system that provides \nreal-time visualisation of the processes occurring inside the blast \nfurnace top and enables continuous measurement of process-\ninfluencing parameters.\nThe system has empowered the operators \nto make interventions in raw material \ndistribution that drastically improved the \nfurnace efficiency and brought down the \nfuel rate.\nInnovative Rust Warning \nSystem at IJmuiden\nAn advanced warning system to prevent condensation on steel \ncoils has been developed. The system predicts the temperature in \nthe storage halls up to 5 days in advance and calculates when the \ndew point is dangerously close to the temperature of the stored \nsteel coils. If condensation is imminent, a warning is triggered. The \nhall manager then knows that the temperature in the hall needs to \nbe raised. The groundbreaking system prevents corrosion, so fewer \nrolls are rejected.\nNew steel coils are not needed to be \nmanufactured for the customer and fewer \nraw materials are used, such as ores and \ncoal. In this way, delays in delivery to the \ncustomers is avoided. Another advantage \nlower energy consumption. The system is \nunique in the manufacturing industry.\nBlast furnace optimisation at \nIJmuiden\nVarious developments on the blast furnace process, including \nmodelling and experimental testing of ceramic materials, \nto prolong the operating times for blast furnaces beyond  \ncurrent limits.\nImproved efficiency of the blast furnaces\nOptimising ladle logistics at \nIJmuiden\nUsing Artificial Intelligence to optimise ladle logistics. Minimising \nheat loss during the transfer of hot metal reduces direct  \nCO2 emissions.\nAllows scrap intake to be increased.\n5.\t\n\u0007Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/web link.\n\t\n\u0007Yes, Tata Steel has an Onsite Emergency Plan and Disaster Control measure in place, focusing on business continuity to \naddress disruptive events like explosions, fire, cyber-attacks, acts of terror, etc. The practices have been benchmarked \nagainst best practices at other organisations with mature Business Continuity Management practices and reference to \nISO 22301:2019 standard on Business Continuity Management Systems. Under the plan, there are defined responsibilities \nfor every group and all individuals involved in handling emergencies. Tata Steel has also established Tactical Centres to \nensure business continuity during emergencies.\n\t\n\u0007In the Netherlands, Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) are in place, and include details of crisis/continuity management teams, \ndisaster response procedures, and communications as appropriate. The BCPs are closely linked with risk management at \nTata Steel Nederland and combine both risk management (failure scenarios) and impacts to usual business processes.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n217\n"

These plans \nare designed on the foundation of a mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimise, restore, \nand offset) tool after a baseline assessment.\nIn the Netherlands, the biodiversity initiatives at the IJmuiden site are part of a \ncomprehensive biodiversity management plan called Staalblauwtje (Steel Blue) \nwhich has been in place for a number of years. It aims to use the site as a corridor \nbetween the two Natura 2000 dune reserves that border the site, creating better \nconnectivity between these areas.\nIn the UK, Tata Steel is guardian to large areas of natural habitat including several areas \nwith the UK designation ‘Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs)’. It works closely with \nthe relevant regulators in England and Wales, agreeing management plans for these \nareas and ensuring responsible stewardship of the habitats and species that thrive on \nthem. In addition to the designated areas with its sites, some of TSUK’s operations are \nin proximity to habitats benefitting from a range of UK habitat designations. In all such \ncases, the environmental permit regulations require the Company to assess any impact \nits operations may have on the adjacent habitats. The assessed impacts are very small. \nAny protections linked to the protected habitats are incorporated into environmental \npermits for the relevant sites and Tata Steel is in compliance with such requirements. In \naddition to meeting its responsibilities for protected sites, where opportunities arise to \ndo so, it looks for ways to encourage biodiversity on other land-holdings and thereby \ncontribute to protecting the natural heritage of the UK’s landscape.\nTata Steel aims to cover 100% of sites under the BMP in India, the UK and the Netherlands \nby 2025. It aims to be a Nature-based Solutions leader in India by 2030.\nFor more details, please refer to the Natural Capital section of Tata Steel’s Integrated \nReport FY2023-24.\nFinancial \nimplications Negative \nB4.\t Research and Development/Technology, Product and Process Innovation\nOpportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/\nopportunity\nTata Steel’s Initiative \nTata Steel is focused on the production \nof value-added or differentiated steel to \nachieve higher margins. Its continuous \nfocus on Research & Development, new \ntechnologies and innovation in products \nand processes is critical for the Company \nto better serve and retain customers, retain \nleadership in differentiated products and \naccess new markets.\nResearch & Development and innovation \nare also critical for Tata Steel to retain \ncost competitiveness by continuous \nimprovement in process efficiency and \nresource utilisation.\nThe importance of Research & Development \nhas increased even more for the Company \nas it focuses on increasing the technological \nmaturity of low carbon steelmaking to \nachieve its Net Zero emissions objective \nand remain a sustainable partner for all  \nits stakeholders.\nTata Steel aspires to be among the top 5 global technology leaders in the steel \nindustry and has consistently used technology and innovation to build a rich \nportfolio of future ready value-added products. Its consistent research efforts are \naimed to retain the Company’s leadership position in attractive segments like \nautomotive steel and packaging steel.\nTata Steel also collaborates with academia and other industries to scale up and \ndeploy new technologies.\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel continued trials at its HIsarna pilot plant in IJmuiden. The \nHIsarna technology is a more energy efficient steelmaking technology as it does \nnot require pre-processing of the ores and metallurgical coal. The Company plans \nto perform test runs with high-alumina ore and natural gas, with the goal to build a \nsecond large demo plant in India in the future.\nIn the UK, Tata Steel is engaged in the following projects to improve the environmental \nand social attributes of its products, services, and processes:\n1.\t\n\u0007Flue-2-Chem: Innovate UK (IUK) sponsored carbon capture and utilisation \naiming to examine the feasibility of emissions capture and use in Organic \nCoated Steel (‘OCS’) products.\n2.\t\n\u0007Sustainable plastisol: Solvent free Plastisol development for OCS.\n3.\t\n\u0007Shotton decarbonisation: Alternatives to gas fired ovens, examining radcure \ntechnologies such as UV/e-beam/induction curing.\n4.\t\n\u0007MireLifeO: IUK sponsored project examining microbially recovered lignin for \nsustainable Building System foams.\n5.\t\n\u0007Building systems panel recycling: In collaboration with Swansea University \nand the University of South Wales, looking at techniques for separation of \nthe organic and metallic coatings in building systems panels for subsequent \nrecycling of the steel.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n164\nStatutory Reports\n"

The processed tubes \nexhibited excellent HIC (Hydrogen induced cracking) and SSCC (Sulphide stress corrosion \ncracking), in addition to the mechanical properties. \n3D Printing Wire Feedstock for Additive \nConstruction\nA 3D printing wire feedstock is developed for large scale additive manufacturing of structural \nsteel application. The work involved designed an alternative chemistry to attain continuously \nstable arc using low Si chemistry for a final tensile strength of a ≥500 MPa equivalent to \nstructural steel grades e.g., S355J and Yst350. The developed 3D printing wire feedstock \nqualified desired properties and produces fewer oxides, 2-3 g per kg of steel deposition, \ncompared to 5-8 g per kg for commercially available wires.\nHigh Strength Welding Consumables for Advanced \nHigh Strength Steels\nER100S-G MIG electrode (min. UTS 690 MPa) has been produced in-house – the electrode \nfinds applications for joining advance high strength steels and strategically situates itself as \na novel product from import substitution perspective. \nCoiling feasibility model for down coiler in Hot \nStrip Mill.\nA mathematical model has been developed based upon co-relation of various operating \nconditions and process parameters to assess coiling feasibility of new grade and/or section \nwith respect to coiler capacity of the respective hot strip mill. Apart from feasibility check, \nthe model has the potential to reduce bad coil shape and energy consumption for existing \ngrades and sections by optimising coiling process parameters. \nPolymer coated CRCA for Ready-to-paint \napplication\nRust preventive (RP) oil is applied over cold rolled steel to prevent temporary corrosion during \ntransit and storage. The RP oil is required to be removed at customers’ end prior to post-\npainting. End-customers are following 7-tanks pre-treatment processes to remove oil and \nthis process involves hazardous chemicals & generate liquid effluents. In the direction of \nelimination of 7 tanks pre-treatment processes at customers’ end, an engineering polymer \ncoating technology has been developed and patented. This technology is mainly developed \nfor cold rolled steel and can be directly applied without any pre-treatment or primer coatings. \nNano Hydroxyapatite (HA) for Dental Application\nBones and teeth have a highly complex structural hierarchy that consists of 65-70% inorganic \ncrystals of Hydroxyapatite (HA) and 30-35% of organic protein (collagen). Tata Steel has \ndeveloped nano HA that has potential to be used in dental applications. The production \nprocess is getting scaled up and samples are sent to customers for validation. The produced \nnano HA showed promising results like good control over shape and size, stability, enhanced \nrepair and regeneration of teeth through remineralisation. \nDevelopment of hot rolled JSH590BN grade with \nmore than 100%-hole expansion ratio.\nThe hot rolled steel exhibited very high stretch flangeability. And Hole expansion ratio, was \nobserved to be higher than 100% . The steel exhibited superior surface finish owing to a silicon \nfree chemistry. This grade finds applications for manufacturing automotive components such \nas rear suspension beam that require very high stretch flangeability during forming operation. \nIncreasing the Ball Mill throughput at Pellet Plant \nby deploying Surface Modifiers\nGlycol based surface modifiers formulations have been deployed – these formulations \nstabilise the charge particles and prevents the re-agglomeration of particles during grinding. \nThe work has resulted in ~10% reduction in ball mill rejects and 2% increase in ball mill \nthroughput at pellet plant.\nImprovement in heat transfer coefficient in \nsintering \nR&D has indigenously developed a metal oxide-based catalyst to improve the convective \nheat transfer. The catalyst addition resulted in increasing the rate of sintering and reducing \nthe coke rate at sinter plant by 1.5 kg/ton of sinter. \nPyrometallurgical processing of Low-Grade \nchromite overburden to extract Nickel and metal \nvalues\nNickel and cobalt are identified as critical minerals for India having end use in stainless steel \nand batteries for EV sector. A novel pyrometallurgical process is developed at R&D to extract \nthe nickel, cobalt, Iron and chromium metal values from chromite overburden produce and \nproduce low grade ferrochrome alloy (Nickel Pig Iron) and slag. Large scale trials have been \ntaken to demonstrate the feasibility of utilising the low-grade chromite overburden in cost-\neffective manner to produce Nickel pig iron.\nDevelopment of value-added products from Low \nGrade Manganese Ores\nTata Steel has developed a novel process for selective extraction of manganese from the \nlow-grade manganese ores in techno-economic manner using SO2 gas to produce various \nvalue-added products (VAPs) for use in Agricultural, Industrial and batteries application.  \nThe VAPs are manganese sulphate (MnSO4.H2O), manganese carbonate (MnCO3),  \nelectrolytic manganese metal (EMM) and electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD). \nSMART Solution Package For energy efficient \nperformance Of Cooling Tower\nSolution comprises a machine learning algorithm that optimises the fan and pump speed \nbased upon ambient temperature and relative humidity as input factors. The proposed \nsolution has resulted in substantial improvements in energy efficiency, reduction in carbon \ndioxide emissions, water savings, operational expenses without causing any operational \ndisturbances. \n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n352\nStatutory Reports\n"

Extending the scope of \nmanufacturing units under LCA, \nin FY2023-24, an LCA study for the \nferrochrome business, including the \nmining operations, was conducted. \nAnother LCA study has been \nconducted for iron powder made \nusing the Company’s by-products. \nGoing forward, a cradle-to-grave \nLCA study will be undertaken in \ncollaboration with the Company’s \ncustomers to holistically comprehend \nthe impact of the Company’s products.\nb) GreenPro: In FY2023-24, \nTata Steel achieved the GreenPro \nEcolabelling Standard certification by \nthe Confederation of Indian Industry \n(CII) for its automotive flat steel \nproducts. Based on a comprehensive \nframework, the ecolabel assesses \nthe green quotient of a product, \npaving the way for environmental \nperformance excellence. As part of \nthe evaluation process, the Company’s \nautomotive flat steel products \nunderwent an end-to-end evaluation \nat every stage of their product \nlifecycle, leading to measurable \nenvironmental benefits.\nc) Environment Product \nDisclosure (EPD): In India, Tata \nSteel has published EPD for steel \nrebars, steel hot rolled coils and steel \nstructural hollow section, under the \nbrand Tata Structura. In the coming \nyears, it aims to receive eco-labels \n(GreenPro) and transparently disclose \nenvironmental performance for Tata \nSteel’s key products manufactured \nacross various sites to support its \nCommitted to preserving natural resources\nTata Steel is undertaking two major \nprojects as part of the Roadmap \nPlus improvement programme in \nthe Netherlands. These include the \nDeNOx installation at the Pellet \nPlant and the 18-metre high and \n1,000 meter long windbreaker around \nthe raw material storage. The DeNOx \ninstallation aims to reduce the Pellet \nPlant’s nitrogen oxide emissions \nby 80%. The windbreaker aims to \nreduce dust emissions from the \nraw material storage.\nIn FY2023-24, three large dedusting \ninstallations have been put into \nuse at the IJmuiden steelworks in \nthe Netherlands. These comprise \nforge hoods at the blast furnaces, \na dedusting installation for flue \ngases at the Pellet Plant and an \nadditional extraction installation \nin the Oxy Steel Factory. The new \ninstallations aim to drastically \nreduce emissions of dust, lead \nand other heavy metals. A new \ncloth filter installation has also \nbeen built at the Pellet factory to \nensure an 80% reduction in lead, \nheavy metals, and dust.\nThe Company is trying to mitigate \nits water-related risks by minimising \ndependence on fresh water and \nmaximising recycling of effluents \nwithin steel plants and reusing \nmunicipal sewage. Further, steps \nlike rainwater harvesting to charge \ngroundwater at operating locations and \nin community areas help in reducing \nthe demand-supply gap.\nMajor initiatives taken by the \nCompany in FY2023-24 to minimise its \nspecific freshwater consumption and \nreduction of effluent discharge include: \n\t»\nIncreased water recovery through \naugmentation of the Central Effluent \nTreatment Plant at Jamshedpur\n\t»\nAchieved ZED (Zero Effluent \nDischarge) at the Kalinganagar plant\n\t»\nIncreased recovery of treated water \nfrom the sewage treatment plants \nat Jamshedpur\n\t»\nIncreased water recovery from the \nstorm runoff streams at Kalinganagar\n\t»\nWater up-gradation projects in LD1 \nand LD2 plants at Jamshedpur\n\t»\nConducted an integrated water \nresource management study of the \nBrahmani river basin\nFor more details, please refer to Question \n5 under Principle 6 - Essential Indicators \nin Tata Steel's Business Responsibility and \nSustainability Report for FY2023-24.\n33%\nReduction in the specific water \nconsumption in India for its crude \nsteel manufacturing sites over the \nlast 5 years\nAir emissions\nDust emission reduction is one \nof the thrust areas to improve \nair quality across the Company’s \noperating locations. \nUpgraded pollution control \nequipment, implementation of \nnew technologies, consistent \ninternal efforts and maintenance \nstrategies have enabled Tata Steel \nto significantly reduce its stack \ndust emissions in India. Between \nFY1994-95 and FY2023-24 stack \ndust emissions at the Jamshedpur \nsteelworks have reduced by 97.8% \n(from 9.07 kg/tcs to 0.2 kg/tcs). At \nKalinganagar, stack dust emissions \nhave gone down by 67% from 1.3 \nkg/tcs in FY 2016-17 to 0.43 kg/tcs \nin FY2023-24. Since its acquisition in \nFY2018-19 the Meramandali plant’s \nstack dust emissions have reduced \nby 54% (from 0.94 kg/tcs to 0.43 kg/\ntcs). At Gamharia, the quantity has \ndecreased by 61% from 2.87 kg/tcs in \nFY2019-20 to 1.11 kg/tcs in FY 2023-24. \nThe Company’s priority is to minimise \nfugitive emissions while setting new \nbenchmarks in stack dust emissions.\ncustomers with product-related \nsustainability information.\nIn Europe, Tata Steel became the \nfirst steel manufacturer globally \nto develop and operate an EPD \nprogramme. The programme \ncovers the development of Type III \nenvironmental declarations in \naccordance with the requirements \nof EN 15804 and ISO 14025:2006. The \nprogramme is intended to support \nTata Steel in communicating its \nenvironmental credentials of its \nproducts in a standardised manner.\nCircular economy\nTransition to scrap-based \nsteelmaking in the UK and \nthe Netherlands\nTata Steel is in discussion with the \nDutch government about closing one of \nits two blast furnaces in the Netherlands \nby 2030 and replacing it with a direct \nreduced iron (DRI) electric arc furnace \n(EAF). It will increase the proportion \nof scrap in steel manufacturing at \nIJmuiden to 30%.\nTata Steel also signed an agreement \nin September 2023 with the UK \nGovernment on proposals to replace the \ntwo blast furnaces at Port Talbot with an \nEAF, reducing direct emissions of CO2 by \n50 MT over a decade.\nThe transition will enable scrap-based \nlow-CO₂ steelmaking by using locally \navailable scrap in the region, thereby not \nonly cutting down emissions but also \nensuring the raw material self-sufficiency \nof the domestic steel industries.\n50 MT\nReduction in direct emissions of  \nCO2 over a decade\nSteel recycling business\nIn India, the Steel Recycling \nBusiness (SRB) completed its \nsecond year of plant operations \nin FY2023-24, clocking nearly \n340 KT despatch. The business has \nleveraged digital power to set up \nrobust supply chains, as the collection \nand aggregation of scrap for the \nrecycling plant entails reverse logistics. \nFerroHaat, a digital app, was launched \nto source steel scrap from scrapyards \nand has gained deep penetration in \nthe supply chain. Over 180 vendors \nhave been registered on the app \nfor scrap supply.\nSRB is also responsible for sourcing \nand supplying the Company's entire \nscrap requirement in India. Besides \nsupplying processed scrap from its \nRohtak plant, it also supplies scrap \nfrom various sources across India. \nThere has been a dedicated effort \nto increase scrap charging in steel \nmelting shops to reduce their carbon \nfootprint. Multiple cross-functional \nstrategy workshops have been \nconducted to develop a roadmap \nfor securitising its long-term \nscrap requirement. \nBesides sustainability benefits, \nthe SRB is also dovetailed with its \nlong products growth strategy. It \nwill cater to the scrap requirement \nof the upcoming EAF at Ludhiana, \nPunjab paving the way for sustainable \nsteelmaking for the Company in India. \n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n110\n111\nValue Creation\nNatural Capital\n"

      "text": "Committed to sustainability, Tata Steel Nederland\nThe two low CO2 candidate \ntechnologies for ore-based steel \nproduction that are likely to become \nscalable are:\n(i)\t Retrofitting existing blast furnace-\nbased facilities with CCUS solutions\n(ii) DRI with Green Hydrogen, and \nany other hydrogen-enriched gas \nsupplemented with the installation of \nEAF-type melting facilities for DRI\nTata Steel has identified both \ntechnologies as technology leadership \nfocus areas and actively engages with \ntechnology providers, academia, \nand other companies regarding their \ndevelopment and scale-up. \nTo increase renewable energy use, \nTata Steel commissioned a floating \nsolar power project with a capacity of \n10.8 MWp (Megawatt peak) on its upper \ncooling pond in the plant, bringing \nthe total capacity to 20.34 MWp solar \nprojects in the Jamshedpur Plant.\nTata Steel obtained environmental \nclearance and begun construction for the \nupcoming 0.75 MTPA scrap-based EAF \nfacility in Ludhiana, Punjab, India.\nTata Steel has entered into a \ndefinitive agreement with Tata Power \nto source 379 MW of captive renewable \npower, which will reduce 50 MT of \ncarbon emissions over the 25-year \ncontract period. This arrangement will \nreplace part of the existing coal-based \npower generation in the Company's \nJamshedpur plant and cater to the \nKalinganagar facility's requirements and \nthe Ludhiana, Punjab, India EAF project. \nFurther, Tata Steel is in discussion \nwith Tata Power Renewable Energy \nLimited to set up a captive solar power \nplant with 70 MW capacity in the state of \nMaharashtra. This project will generate \n~17 MW of renewable power and reduce \n115 kilotonnes of carbon annually. \nThis will make ~49% of Tarapur and \nKhopoli power green. With this, Tata \nSteel Limited’s total installed captive \nrenewable power capacity will be \n1,036 MW, meeting around 16% power \nrequirement.\nTata Steel also completed a first-in-\nthe-world trial of hydrogen injection in \nthe E Blast Furnace in Jamshedpur, of up \nto 40% of injection capacity for 3.5 days. \nAs part of its ongoing efforts to \ndecarbonise the steel sector, Tata Steel \nannounced 'Tata Steel - Sprint to Zero' \n2023 Challenge, an initiative to fund \ninnovative research and development \nprojects in low carbon hydrogen that \noffers tech-led or tech-enabled solutions \nto address green hydrogen technologies \nfor the industrial sector's sustainable \nfuture. The announcement is part of \nthe UK-India Hydrogen Partnerships, \nwhich builds on the UK-India Hydrogen \nHub announced by the UK and Indian \nPrime Ministers in 2022. Tata Steel is the \nfirst sponsor of the UK-India Hydrogen \nPartnerships sprint series to support \ninnovative projects in low-carbon \nhydrogen. The Company will also offer \nexperiential engagement to selected \nentities as part of the Challenge, \nincluding priority access to its integrated \nsteel plants.\nTata Steel has become the first Indian \nsteel company to join hands with the \nLeadership Group for Industry Transition \n(LeadIT), aiming to collaborate with \ncountries and companies striving to \nachieve Net Zero emissions in heavy \nindustry. Backed by the World Economic \nForum, LeadIT was instituted by the \ngovernments of Sweden and India \nduring the UN Climate Action Summit \nin September 2019. This collaboration \nallows Tata Steel to gain valuable \ninsights, best practices, and innovative \nideas related to sustainable practices and \ngreen technologies in the steel sector. \nTata Steel and ABB have signed \na memorandum of understanding \n(MoU) to co-create innovative models \nand technologies to help reduce steel \nproduction's carbon footprint. ABB will \nbring global experience in automation, \nelectrification, and digitalisation to the \nmining and metals industries.\nAs part of scrap recycling in \nsteelmaking, Tata Steel is increasing \nits share of scrap utilisation across \nJamshedpur, Kalinganagar, Meramandali, \nand Gamharia. Using the short sea route, \nTata Steel launched the Multimodal \nService to streamline the scrap supply \nchain and move scrap from Chennai \nto Tata Steel sites. It is a first-of-its-\nkind green supply chain solution to \ncontainerise scrap movement on the east \ncoast of India.\nTata Steel also received the first batch \nof deliveries of next-generation, green-\nfuel-powered commercial vehicles, \nincluding Prima tractor-trailers, tippers, \nand the Ultra EV bus, all powered by low \nand emission-free technologies – LNG \nand electric batteries. The green-fuel-\npowered vehicle will address the Scope \n3 emissions in road transportation and \nreduce 0.74 kg CO2/km using Electric \nVehicles (EV) and 0.13 kg CO2/km \nusing LNG.\nTata Steel is also evaluating the \nfeasibility of investments in gas-based \nDRI production, using natural gas, \ncoke oven gas, or syngas from coal \ngasification as a transitional technology \nuntil cost-competitive Green Hydrogen \nbecomes available.\nTata Steel has completed pilot \nprojects at Tata Steel Meramandali \nand Tata Steel Nederland which makes \nuse of E-Liability carbon accounting \nmethodology. This methodology, \ndeveloped by Prof Robert S Kaplan and \nProf Karthik Ramanna, aims to help \ncompanies tackle ESG reporting in a \nmore targeted and auditable way by \nmeasuring GHG emissions at a product \nlevel rather than an entity level. It thereby \ngoes beyond the Greenhouse Gas \nProtocol and uses traditional accounting \nprinciples for carbon accounting.\nEurope \nTata Steel aims to achieve a \nCO₂ reduction of about 40% as early \nas 2030 for its steelmaking site in \nIJmuiden, the Netherlands. For Tata \nSteel Nederland downstream sites, the \nambition is to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n The Company is engaged in a \ntransformational project to replace its \nexisting heavy-end iron and steelmaking \nassets at Port Talbot in the UK with an \nEAF. The transformation is expected to \nreduce direct emissions from the site \nby approximately 5 MT and reduce the \ndirect CO₂ emissions per tonne of crude \nsteel production by over than 90%. This \ntransformation represents a huge stride \nforward for Tata Steel UK in meeting its \nNet Zero by 2045 ambition.\nDriven by a combination of \ngovernment action and the increasing \nexpectations of customers and broader \nsociety, the pressure to decarbonise \nits steelmaking operations has \nbeen felt keenly in the UK and the \nNetherlands. The Dutch and the UK \ngovernments seek leadership positions \nin global climate action. The European \nCommission adopted its 'Fit for 55' \npackage of proposals in 2021 to align \nthe EU's climate, energy, land use, \ntransport, and taxation policies with \nthe legal objective of reducing net \ngreenhouse gas emissions by at least \n55% by 2030, compared to 1990. Since \nthen, the EU institutions have increased \nthe stringency of the cornerstone EU \nEmissions Trading System (EU ETS). \nAlso, in specific industry sectors \n(cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electric \nenergy production, hydrogen, iron and \nsteel, some precursors, and a limited \nnumber of downstream products), free \nallocation of EU ETS will be gradually \nphased out. It is due to the introduction \nof the Carbon Border Adjustment \nMechanism (CBAM), a new measure to \nmitigate the risk of carbon leakage as the \nEU ramps up its climate ambition. \nThe United Kingdom was amongst \nthe first countries to legislate for \nNet Zero by 2050 and, in early 2021, \nannounced its acceptance of the \nrecommendations of its statutory \nadvisory committee on climate change \n(UKCCC) to ensure (i) the UK achieves \na 78% reduction in emissions by 2035 \n(compared to 1990) and (ii) that ore-\nbased steelmaking in the UK achieves \n'near-zero' emissions by 2035. In 2023, \nthe UK government announced that \nit would tighten emissions reduction \ntrajectory across the traded sector \n(i.e., those in the UK Emissions Trading \nScheme (UK ETS)) in line with its Net Zero \nby 2050 legislation, which equates to a \n~53% reduction in emissions by 2030 \ncompared to 2019. It has also announced \nits commitment to a robust suite of \nmeasures to mitigate carbon leakage, \nincluding a UK CBAM, mandatory \nproduct standards, and measures to \ngrow market demand for low-carbon \nproducts. The UK CBAM is expected to \nbe effective from 2027.\nTata Steel understands that CBAMs \nfor the EU and UK are vital to ensure a \nlevel playing field for steel producers \nin those regions while governments \nare pursuing climate policies that \nincrease the cost of emitting CO₂. The \nprecise design of CBAM requires careful \nattention to ensure that the extra costs \nfaced by steel producers in the EU \nand UK do not cause the relocation of \nsteel production and steel-intensive \nmanufacturing to countries and regions \nof the world with little or no cost of \nemitting CO₂. At the same time, it is \nessential that a level playing field be \nmaintained between the UK and the EU.\nTata Steel is committed to working \nclosely with policymakers to deliver a \nprofoundly significant contribution to \nachieving national emissions reduction \naspirations. The Group's emission \nreduction commitments, participation \nin global initiatives and other actions \nto date are evidence of this. Across \nEurope, there is a growing recognition \nthat steelmakers need government \nsupport to decarbonise. Steelmakers \nand governments in several countries \nare working together to develop \ntheir decarbonisation plans, with \nsuch discussions covering a selection \nof suitable technology, access to \nabundant, green energy supply and \ninfrastructure at a competitive price, \npossible fiscal support from the national \ngovernments, and the need to create \n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n118\n119\nValue Creation\nClimate Change Report\n"

The assessments are conducted \nby independent external advisors, in line with global standards, every 3 years. The last assessment for the Tata Steel Group \nwas conducted in FY2022-23.\n\t\n\u0007As the outcome of the exercise, the following material issues pertaining to environmental and social matters were identified \nby Tata Steel, covering both risks and opportunities:\nMaterial issues identified\nA.\t\nSTRATEGIC \nA1.\t \u0007Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Management\nRisk \nRationale for identifying the risk/\nopportunity\nApproach to adapt or mitigate\nA significant part of Tata Steel’s production \nis through the blast furnace route, which is \nan emission intensive process. Tata Steel has \ncommitted to be Net Zero by 2045 and a \ntransition to low carbon steelmaking is critical \nfor the long-term success of the Company.\nIn India, Tata Steel has adopted multiple strategies to decarbonise its blast furnace \nroute operations. It has also started building its first Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) based \ngreen steel plant in Ludhiana, Punjab.\nIn the UK and the Netherlands, Tata Steel has taken concrete steps to transition to \ngreen steelmaking.\nThe detailed strategy to mitigate climate change-related risks is published in its Climate \nChange Report. It is a part of Tata Steel Limited’s Integrated Report for FY2023-24.\nFinancial \nimplications \nDetails of financial impact on the Company is provided in the Climate Change Report, included in the Integrated Report for \nFY2023 -24\nA2.\t Circular Economy\nOpportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/\nopportunity\nTata Steel’s Initiatives\nSteel as a material lends itself handsomely \nto circularity and is recyclable as ferrous \nscrap to produce new steel. Recycled steel \nhas a significantly lower carbon footprint, \nas opposed to producing primary steel by \nreducing iron ore. Towards the target to be \nNet Zero by 2045, Tata Steel has increased \nscrap usage in its steelmaking process.\nTata Steel produces waste during its \nsteelmaking process, which can either be \nreused in its process (and reduce operating \ncosts) or sold to external parties (e.g., sale \nof slag to the cement industry), creating \nadditional revenue for the Company.\nIn India, Tata Steel has two approaches for value creation from circularity:\na.\t\n\u0007The Industrial By-Products Management Division (IBMD) works to generate \nvalue from by-products. (For details, please refer to Section C, Principle 6, Essential \nIndicators, Question 9).\nb.\t\n\u0007The Steel Recycling Business (SRB) is responsible for sourcing and supplying \nthe entire scrap requirement of Tata Steel in India. Besides supplying processed \nscrap from its Rohtak (Haryana) plant, it also supplies scrap from various sources \nacross India. Tata Steel aims to maximise the amount of scrap charged into its \nexisting blast furnace operations and the upcoming EAF-based green steel \nplant at Ludhiana, Punjab.\nIn the Netherlands, Tata Steel plans to increase the percentage of scrap used in \nsteelmaking from 17% (in 2019) to 30% by 2030. Presently the scrap used is 20%.\nIn the UK, locally sourced scrap will be key for operating the proposed EAF.\nFinancial \nimplications Positive\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n161\n"

The 4 steps are:\n\t\na)\t\n\u0007Planning/product selection - ESG risks within our supply chain are identified and a comprehensive understanding \nis developed on the sustainable products and suppliers (suppliers with ResponsibleSteel or equivalent certifications) \nin the market.\n\t\nb)\t\n\u0007Vendor selection - During the vendor selection phase, only those vendors who have successfully qualified our \nassessment process will be considered for future business.\n\t\nc)\t\n\u0007Evaluation and contract issuance - The sustainability performance of our suppliers will be assessed and incentives \nwill be provided to those who demonstrate superior performance.\n\t\nd)\t\n\u0007Contract Management - Sustainability requirements will be integrated into the contract documents and mechanisms \nestablished for performance monitoring\n\t\n\u0007As a member of ResponsibleSteelTM, Tata Steel also promotes and recognises other relevant programmes, such as the \nResponsible Minerals Initiative, amongst its suppliers. Since 2019, Tata Steel Nederland has also been a member of the \nMetal Covenant, an initiative of the Social and Economic Council, where the government, unions, non-governmental \norganisations, and companies collaborate on the implementation of the OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct \nand work on improving conditions in the metals value chain.\n\t\n\u0007In the UK, in FY2023-24, Tata Steel had a procurement spent of ~£1.2 billion with approximately 2,500 ‘active’ vendors of \nwhich 625 vendors, had been qualified or re-qualified through SAP Ariba which includes alignment with the Company’s \nResponsible Supply Chain Policy. 100% of Tata Steel UK vendors are made aware of the policy during their onboarding \nprocess. The Company is currently in the process of developing Tata Steel UK Responsible Sourcing & Modern Slavery Policies.\nb.\t\nIf yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?\n\t\n\u0007All suppliers of Tata Steel must declare their commitments to Tata Steel’s sustainability expectations during registration.100% \nof Tata Steel’s inputs in India are sourced from suppliers who commit to its guiding principles by providing declarations \nduring the vendor onboarding /registration phase.  \n\t\n\u0007In the UK, 94% of the suppliers have committed to Tata Steel’s RSCP. In the Netherlands, 48% of Tata Steel’s inputs are \nsourced through suppliers who commit to the guiding principles or equivalent.\n3.\t\n\u0007Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end \nof life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.\n\t\n\u0007Steel has a very long useful life (typically 25 to 30 years) due to its durability before it needs to be scrapped and recycled. \nSteel is ideally suited to a circular economy: it is durable and flexible with a long lifespan, provides many opportunities for \nits reuse and product life extension, is easily recovered and recycled after scrapping due to its magnetic properties, and \ncan produce new steel using well-proven low-carbon technology. Steel is the only genuinely cradle-to-cradle recycled \nmaterial, and end-of-life steel, or scrap steel, is not considered a waste product by the steel industry. Instead, it is regarded \nas an input for steelmaking by remelting and is a globally traded commodity.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel is committed to circularity and looks to maximise the use of steel scrap in its operations. Accordingly, Tata Steel \nreuses scrap generated during the production process as well as procures external scrap. In FY2023-24, Tata Steel recycled \naround 4.3 million tonnes of scrap (~1.8 million tonnes internal scrap and ~2.5 million tonnes external scrap).\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n178\nStatutory Reports\n"

Describe the strategy adopted \nby your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the \npractices adopted to manage such wastes.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel believes in the ‘Zero Waste’ philosophy using the 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle) circular economy principles. Tata \nSteel has collaborated with suppliers and taken up several projects to refurbish equipment under use, improving their life \nand preventing unnecessary waste. In a first-of-its-kind initiative in India, Tata Steel successfully recycled 12,000 tonnes of \nused refractories, contributing towards its sustainability goals. Tata Steel also initiated trial runs with its suppliers to switch \nfrom high-speed diesel to alternate fuels, such as Liquefied Natural Gas, to decarbonise its mining operations.\n\t\n\u0007To minimise the waste produced in the steelmaking process, Tata Steel has a dedicated profit centre for waste management, \ncalled the Industrial By-Product Management Division (IBMD), to ensure efficient by-product management by adopting \nadvanced practices for steel waste processing.\n\t\ni)\t\n\u0007Reuse & Recycle: Ironmaking and steelmaking slags are the major by-products generated in the steel industry. Other \nby-products include dust, sludge, mill scales, waste refractories, etc. The by-products are used in various external \napplications (BF slag in cement manufacturing, metallics in secondary steelmaking, coal tar in coal tar pitch and \nCarbon Black, and non-metallics of steelmaking slag in civil works, road construction, fly ash bricks) and internal \napplications (flue dust, lime dust, steelmaking sludge, kiln dust, mill scale and sludge, iron-bearing muck, GCP (Gas \nCleaning Plant) sludge, LD slag fines, etc., in sinter making, and metallics in steelmaking).\n\t\nii)\t\n\u0007Resource Recovery and Utilisation: Tata Steel has invested in state-of-the-art technologies for processing by-products \nto maximise value creation. A few of the key facilities are as follows:\n\t\n\t\na)\t\n\u0007Metal Recovery and Steam Ageing Plant: Here, the steelmaking by-product slag undergoes crushing and \nscreening, followed by magnetic separation that recovers the iron content to be used as a raw material in the \nsteelmaking process. Non-metallic slag aggregates that undergo weathering at the steam ageing facility are \nused for civil or road construction. The fines are used as a cementitious material.\n\t\n\t\nb)\t\n\u0007Scrap Processing-Storage-Handling Facility: As a significant CO2 reduction initiative, IBMD collects and \nprocesses internal scrap to maximise the scrap charge in steel melting shops. It generated a total scrap volume \nof 1207 KT, comprising 917 KT of steel scrap, which helped reduce the equivalent volume of external scrap buy.\n\t\n\t\nc)\t\n\u0007New By-product Value Creation Centre: A state-of-the-art facility equipped with a baling machine, specialised \ncut-to-length line, and a mechanised processing line for flat product arisings has been set up to deliver customised \nofferings to external customers. The facility also houses an Innovation Lab to develop light concrete products \nusing in-house slag aggregates such as Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman. Green pavers and interlocking blocks \nhave been developed with slag-based aggregates.\n\t\n\t\nd)\t\n\u0007Slag Processing & Grinding Plant: The slag generated during the ironmaking process in Blast Furnaces (BF slag) \nis divided into air-cooled slag and granulated slag. Granulated BF slag is sold to cement manufacturers, whereas \nair-cooled slag is processed and utilised in road construction. GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag) was \nintroduced to create additional value from BF slag, which can be used as a partial replacement for Ordinary \nPortland Cement (OPC) in concrete production. Tata Steel GGBS is now available under the name ‘Tata Dureco.’\n\t\niii)\t\n\u0007E-Waste Management: The Company has established a process to ensure effective e-waste management in \ncompliance with the E-Waste Management (EWM) Rules, 2016. The electronic waste is collected at a central location \nand managed by the authorised vendor. They are certified to undertake the activities as per the rules and guidelines \nissued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\n\t\n\u0007While most processed solid waste is reutilised within the manufacturing process, Tata Steel partners with external agencies \nto dispose of hazardous waste in a secure landfill that is not processed or recycled.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n211\n"

Though the \nprices of these consumables have been on a gradual \ndecline over the months, changes in market sentiment \nin China has the potential to affect the volatility of \nthese materials.\n\t» \u0007Changes in statutory and sustainability norms in \nimporting/exporting countries pose a threat to the \nreliability of the supply chain.\n\t» \u0007Exposure to energy shortages and price increases \nare also a relevant risk due to multiple ongoing \ngeopolitical disruptions.\n\t\nMitigation Strategies\n\t\n\u0007Changing prices of coal and iron ore generally reflect \nthrough adjustments in steel prices, which in effect acts \nas a natural hedge against volatility. However, there may \nbe a lead and lag involved and hence, several steps are \nbeing taken to manage the price volatility –\n\t» For iron ore buy from external market, the Company \nhedges the spread between the bought-out ore and \nconfirmed steel orders. The Company has also started \nhedging of coal buy.\n\t» Price forecasting tools are being used for commodities \nlike Coal, Zinc, Aluminum etc. to understand price \nmovements and time the buy to optimise costs.\n\t» \u0007Tools like reverse auctions are being used for efficient \nprice discovery for commodities like coal, ferro alloys, \nrefractories etc.\n\t» \u0007Captive/domestic raw materials provide another \navenue to guard against volatility as they have \nrelatively stable cost/price.\n\t» \u0007Diversifying coal sourcing from countries like \nIndonesia, USA, and Canada and long-term  \ntie-ups to secure preferred grades to ensure  \nlong-term supply security.\n\t» \u0007Trial of new grades of coals and blend optimisation \nwith increased usage of weaker/lower cost coals are \nused to mitigate price risk.\n\t» \u0007Evaluating potential sources with other geographical \nlocations in Odisha and Chhattisgarh - like IB valley \ncoalfield and Talabira mines in Odisha and Kusmunda \nand Gevra which are the collieries of South-Eastern \nCoalfields Limited in Chhattisgarh to minimise the risk \non supply security of non-coking thermal coal.\n\t» \u0007Contracting with local suppliers by rail mode to \nincrease the rail co-efficient for consistent and uniform \ndomestic coal supplies.\n\t» \u0007Maximising Fuel Supply agreement to mitigate the risk \nof prevailing market volatility due to gap in demand \nand supply effecting premiums of spot auction events.\n\t» \u0007For bulk commodities, Indigenisation has been \nidentified as one of the major levers to de-risk \nthe supply chain for both direct and indirect \ncommodities which are dependent on import sources  \n(like De-Sulphurisation compounds, refractories, \ncored wires etc.) to ensure safeguarding against  \ngeo-political escalations and single country \ndependence.

      "text": "I.\t\nOverview\n\t\n\u0007The objective of this report is to convey the \nManagement’s perspective on the external  \nenvironment and steel industry, as well as strategy, \noperating and financial performance, material \ndevelopments in human resources and industrial \nrelations, risks and opportunities and internal control \nsystems and their adequacy in the Company during \nFinancial Year 2023-24. This should be read in conjunction \nwith the Company’s financial statements, the schedules \nand notes thereto and other information included \nelsewhere in the Integrated Report and Annual Accounts \n2023-24. The Company’s financial statements have \nbeen prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting \nStandards (‘Ind AS’) complying with the requirements \nof the Companies Act, 2013, as amended and regulations \nissued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India \n(‘SEBI’) from time to time.\nII.\t External Environment\n1.\t\nGlobal Economy\n\t\n\u0007The global economy continues to show resilience \ndespite facing several strong headwinds viz., the Middle \nEast crisis, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, high inflation, \nhigh costs and falling household purchasing power, \nrising geopolitical uncertainties, and forced monetary \ntightening. Global growth is estimated to sustain at 3.2% \nin 2024, similar to 2023. The economy is better placed \nnow than at the same time in 2023, with the risk of a \nglobal recession receding. In late 2023, headline inflation \nneared its pre-pandemic level in most economies for \nthe first time since the start of the global inflation surge. \nAs global inflation descended from its peak, economic \nactivity grew steadily, defying warnings of stagflation \nand global recession. The United States with some \nmiddle-income economies displayed strong economic \nperformance, with aggregate demand supported by \nstronger than expected private consumption amidst \nstill tight though easing labour markets. Continuing \ngeopolitical tensions, including the Middle East crisis, \nRussia-Ukraine war and the upcoming US presidential \nelections pose a risk to dampen growth in 2024.\n\t\n\u0007Growth in the United States is expected to be 2.4% in \n2024, while the Eurozone is expected to witness a minor \nrecovery of 0.7%. Recovery in Europe will be driven by \ndeclining inflation and energy prices normalising. China \nwitnessed stronger-than-expected growth of 5.2% in \n2023, with 2024 growth projected at 4.65%. Industrial \novercapacity, continued slowdown in domestic demand, \ndeepening deflation and heightened trade tensions \nwith the West will remain major headwinds for China \nthroughout 2024.\n\t\nEconomic Outlook\n\t\n\u0007The baseline forecast is for the world economy to \ncontinue growing at 3.2% during 2024 and 2025, at the \nsame pace as in 2023. A slight acceleration for advanced \neconomies where growth is expected to rise from 1.6% \nin 2023 to 1.7% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025 will be offset by \na modest slowdown in emerging market and developing \neconomies from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in both 2024 \nand 2025.\n\t\n\u0007Global inflation is forecast to decline steadily, from 6.8% \nin 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025, with advanced \neconomies returning to their inflation targets sooner \nthan emerging market and developing economies. Core \ninflation is generally projected to decline more gradually.\n\t\n\u0007Energy prices are expected to rationalise in 2024. \nCoal and natural gas prices are expected to continue \ndeclining from their earlier peaks with the gas market \nbecoming increasingly balanced on account of new \nsupply, dampened demand, and high storage levels. \nThe forecast for non-fuel commodity prices is expected \nto be broadly stable in 2024, with prices for base metals \nexpected to fall on account of weaker industrial activity \nin Europe and China.\n\t\n\u0007With inflation projected to reduce in this year, policy \nrates of central banks in major advanced economies are \nexpected to start declining in the second half of 2024. \nGovernments are expected to tighten fiscal policy in \n2024 and, to a lesser extent, in FY2025–26. Among major \nadvanced economies, the structural fiscal balance to GDP \nratio is expected to rise in the United States and in the \neuro area in 2024. In emerging market and developing \neconomies, the projected fiscal stance is expected to be, \non average, broadly neutral in 2024, with a tightening \nprojected for 2025.\n\t\n\u0007Advanced economies are expected to see incremental \ngrowth, largely reflecting a recovery in the euro area \nfrom low growth in 2023. Developing economies are \nexpected to experience stable growth through 2024 and \n2025, with regional differences.\nANNEXURE 1\nManagement Discussion and Analysis 2023-24\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n254\nStatutory Reports\n"

      "text": "\t\n\u0007China is expected to witness its slowest growth since \nthe mid-90’s, outside of the pandemic years. Property \nsector will continue to remain weak with falling demand \nand developers lacking finances to complete projects. \nTrade growth is also expected to remain low due to \nsubdued global demand. There remains a possibility that \nthe Middle East conflict escalates which could have far \nreaching impact, including rise in oil prices and shipping \nchallenges especially for containerships through the \nRed Sea.\n2.\t\nIndian Economy\n\t\n\u0007India’s economic growth has been resilient against \nglobal headwinds for three fiscal years now. Policy and \nregulatory support and prudence have helped, as has the \ngradual reinvigoration of the private sector.\n\t\n\u0007The Country’s attractiveness as an investment destination \nremains robust, given the size and scale of operations it \nhas to offer to global companies, abundant skilled talent \npool, and prowess in technology and innovation.\n\t\n\u0007The industrial manufacturing sector has experienced a \nsignificant boost, attracting global technology giants \nto expand their supplier networks within India. This \nmomentum is further supported by the implementation \nof state industrial policies that complement sector \nspecific incentive schemes. Concurrently, substantial \ninvestments in logistics and infrastructure development, \nincluding the construction of new roads, highways, and \nrail tracks, underscore the Government’s commitment \nto bolstering this critical sector. Capital spending by \nthe Government and strong manufacturing activity \nhave meaningfully contributed to the robust growth \noutcomes in 2023.\n\t\n\u0007Various Production Linked Incentive (‘PLI’) schemes \nhave revived the manufacturing sector post pandemic. \nThey are helping build up critical value chains and \nindustrial clusters, besides expanding the Country’s \nexport basket. Overall, the PLI schemes have brought \nin a new regulatory framework, which can be aligned \nto address industrial and manufacturing technology \ndeficiencies and improve output. The Government is also \ncontemplating extending the scheme to further sectors, \nto develop new segments in labour intensive sectors.\n\t\n\u0007Services export grew on a year-on-year basis on the back \nof rising exports of software, business and travel services. \nThe rise in net services exports receipts and softening of \nthe global commodity prices, more than compensated \nfor a slight rise in merchandise trade deficit. This has \nhelped cushion the Current Account Deficit (‘CAD’).\n\t\n\u0007India’s retail inflation for FY2023-24 has seen a significant \ndownturn, marking its lowest point since the onset of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Reflecting this trend, the Reserve \nBank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (‘MPC’) in \nits recent meeting, decided to maintain policy rates at \ntheir current levels, citing the ongoing reduction in price \npressures across the country.\n3.\t\nGlobal Steel Industry\n\t\n\u0007Steel industry has been impacted by high inflation \nand interest rate environment in addition to growing \ngeo-economic fragmentation. The slowdown of steel \nconsuming sectors, especially in EU & US continued in \n2023 as investment and consumption weakened. The \ndelayed effect of tightening monetary policy may allow \nslow recovery in 2024 in advanced economies while \nemerging economies, particularly Asia may grow faster. \nPersistent core inflation, high oil prices and tight job \nmarket remain the downside risks to stabilising inflation.\n\t\n\u0007As Tata Steel approaches the end of this monetary \ntightening cycle, tighter credit conditions and higher \ncosts have led to a sharp slowdown in housing activity in \nmost major markets and have hampered manufacturing \nsector globally. While it seems the world economy will \nexperience a soft landing from this monetary tightening \ncycle, global steel demand growth is expected to remain \nweak and market volatility remaining high on lagged \nimpact of monetary tightening, high costs and high \ngeopolitical uncertainties. While residential construction \nhas been impacted by high interest rates, infrastructure \ninvestments have cushioned the impact in many regions, \nincluding advanced economies. Manufacturing and \nconsumer durables sectors continued to slow against \nweak demand. While automotive recovery continued in \n2023, it’s expected to decelerate in 2024.\n\t\n\u0007Chinese economy is in a structural transition phase. \nThe property sector turmoil impacted domestic steel \ndemand through most of 2023, albeit the position \nimproved slightly in the later half of the year largely on \naccount of Government interventions. 2023 witnessed \na growth of ~9% in steel exports from China leading to \nsoftening prices in the international market and lowering \nprofitability of mills in emerging markets. Steel demand \nin China in 2024 is expected to remain around the level \nof 2023, as real estate investments continue to decline, \nbut the corresponding steel demand loss will be offset \nby growth in steel demand coming from infrastructure \ninvestments and manufacturing sectors.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n255\n"

      "text": "logistics cost reduction and improved \nfacility utilisation.\nMeanwhile, the merger \nprocess for three other entities – \nBhubaneswar Power Private Limited, \nAngul Energy Limited, and The Indian \nSteel and Wire Products Limited is \nexpected to be completed in the first \nhalf of FY2024-25.\nQ  Can you elaborate on the \nreasons for Tata Steel's decision to \nsurrender its Sukinda mine lease \nand closure of operations? What \nhas been the financial impact of this \nsurrender?\nThe Sukinda mine faced significant \noperational and regulatory challenges \nleading to its surrender. Historically \noperated through open cast mining, \nthe mine’s reserves depleted. To \ncontinue extraction, transitioning to \nunderground mining was necessary. \nThe shift would have taken 2-3 years \nto commence, during which period \nproduction was to be on hold.\n However, the mining regulations, \nincluding the Mine Development and \nProduction Agreement (MDPA) targets, \ndid not provide the required flexibility \nfor the transition. Consequently, \nwe decided to surrender the mine, \nresulting in a one-time cost of \napproximately ₹500 crore.\nQ  What were the sustainability \nefforts made by Tata Steel during \nthe previous year?\nTata Steel has a multipronged \napproach to progress on its \nsustainability journey and many \ninitiatives are undertaken with the \naim of reducing our carbon footprint, \nenhancing resource efficiency, and \nfostering a sustainable future.\nTata Steel is among the first \nmovers in decarbonising steelmaking \noperations. The Company has \nannounced its plans to transition \nto low-CO₂ steel manufacturing \nacross operations in the UK and \nthe Netherlands. \n \nThe construction of our first low-\ncarbon steel plant in Ludhiana, Punjab, \nIndia has started. This scrap-based EAF \nfacility will significantly reduce carbon \nemissions compared to traditional \nsteelmaking. The plant is expected to \nbe commissioned by March 2025 and \nwill produce 0.75 MT of steel annually.\nTata Steel finalised agreements \nwith Tata Power Renewable Energy \nLimited and TP Vardhman Surya \nLimited to source 379 MW of captive \nrenewable power. This strategic move \nis expected to reduce 50 MT of carbon \nemissions over 25 years.\nWe also undertook pilots to \navoid or convert captured carbon \nemissions including measures to \ngreen our energy mix such as biochar \nand hydrogen. We championed \nbamboo plantation in our leasehold \nland and communities’ barren land \naround our Jharia coal mines. This \ncollaboration aims to generate \nlivelihood opportunities for farmers \nand act as a carbon sink over time. \nThe bamboo can be converted into \nbiochar which can replace, to a certain \nextent, pulverised coal injection in our \nblast furnaces to reduce emissions. Our \nwater conservation efforts led to zero \neffluent discharge at Kalinganagar site.\nWe integrated an eco-conscious \nfleet of advanced commercial vehicles \nfrom Tata Motors into our operations. \nThese vehicles, powered by LNG and \nelectric batteries, are expected to \nsignificantly reduce our Scope 3 CO2 \nemissions in road transportation.\nWe also completed a full-\nladen voyage using B24 biofuel, \ntransporting 1,48,500 tonnes of coal \nfrom Gladstone, Australia to Paradip, \nIndia and achieved a 20% reduction \nin carbon emissions. The B24-grade \nbiofuel blend consisted of 24% used \ncooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) and \n76% very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). \nWe also became the first company in \nIndia to use LNG-powered capsize bulk \ncarrier for transporting raw materials. \nThese milestones highlight our \ncommitment to sustainable maritime \npractices.\nThe Company signed an MoU with \nImperial College London to invest \n£10 million to establish a Centre for \nInnovation in Sustainable Design and \nManufacturing that will focus on smart \nmanufacturing techniques, sustainable \nmulti-material joining technologies, \nand Net Zero construction \ninnovations. The Company also joined \nthe Leadership Group for Industry \nTransition (LeadIT), a platform initiated \nby Sweden and India, that fosters \nNet Zero transitions across heavy \nindustries through initiatives such as \nCoal Bed Methane (CBM) injection, \nhydrogen injection in blast furnaces, \nand carbon capture plant.\nWe launched ‘Tata Steel – Sprint \nto Zero’ 2023 challenge to fund \ninnovative projects focused on low-\ncarbon hydrogen technologies. The \ninitiative aligning with the UK-India \nhydrogen partnership supports two \ngroundbreaking projects aimed at \ndecarbonising the steel Industry.\nOur Kalinganagar and \nMeramandali plants received the \nResponsibleSteelTM Certification, with \nover 90% of our steel production \ncapacity in India now accredited under \nthis framework. This certification \nacknowledges our dedication to \nenvironmental stewardship and \nresponsible business practices. \nReaffirming this deep-rooted \ncommitment to sustainability, Tata \nSteel was distinguished as a Steel \nSustainability Champion by the World \nSteel Association (worldsteel) for the \nseventh consecutive year, marking \nits unwavering recognition since \nthe inception of this demanding \nsustainability programme.\nTata Steel has a \nmultipronged approach \nto progress on its \nsustainability journey \nand many initiatives \nundertaken with the \naim of reducing our \ncarbon footprint, \nenhancing resource \nefficiency, and fostering a \nsustainable future.\nContinuous Annealing Line, Tata Steel Kalinganagar\nManagement Speak\nQ  Could you elaborate on \nthe Company's initiatives for \ncommunity engagement and \noutreach in the regions where \nit operates?\nTata Steel has implemented a \ncomprehensive range of community \nengagement and outreach initiatives \naimed at fostering sustainable \ndevelopment and improving the quality \nof life in the regions where it operates.\nTata Steel Foundation (TSF) \nanchors the Company’s social impact \nprogrammes, which impacted \n4.4 million people in FY2023-24. TSF \nfocuses on designing scalable and \nreplicable change models across \neducation, public health, tribal identity, \nlivelihoods, agriculture, water, and \ndisability.\nOur Initiatives like the MANSI+ \n(Maternal and Newborn Survival \nInitiative) operates in over 50 \ndevelopment blocks across districts in \nJharkhand and has helped to stabilise \nover 80% of identified severely acute \nmalnourished newborn children. This \ninitiative has been crucial in reducing \ninfant mortality rates in the region.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n30\n31\nOur Leadership\n"

      "text": "A3.\t Water Consumption and Effluent Discharge\nRisk\nRationale for identifying the risk/\nopportunity\nApproach to adapt or mitigate\nTata Steel utilises a large amount of water \nin its processes and draws it from multiple \nsources. Tata Steel’s water consumption \nis regulated in all geographies. Non-\ncompliance with regulatory requirements \nregarding effluent discharge and higher \nwater usage may result in environmental \ncompensation by regulatory authorities, \nfinancial loss due to operational stoppage \nand withdrawal of licence to operate. \nAs a result of climate change, some \ngeographies are expected to have \nreduced access to fresh water, making \nit a scarce resource. To be cost-efficient, \nTata Steel must minimise water usage and  \nmaximise recycling.\n1.\t\n\u0007Addressing water scarcity through the 4R framework of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle \nand Recover:\n\t\na.\t\n\u0007Reducing fresh water withdrawal to a minimum from rivers by maximising \nthe recycling of treated waste effluents within the plant through effluent \ntreatment plants and online continuous effluent analysers.\n\t\nb.\t\n\u0007Reusing treated municipal wastewater and water harvesting infrastructure \nacross multiple locations. In India, Tata Steel aims to achieve ZED (Zero \nEffluent Discharge) from Works premises and plans to build water  \nefficient infrastructure.\n\t\nc.\t\n\u0007Increased water recovery through an augmentation of the Central Effluent \nTreatment Plant and sewage treatment plants as well as from storm  \nrun-off streams.\n2.\t\n\u0007Adopting best available technologies like dry processes to reduce, best practices \nlike catch pit and pumping infrastructure to recover, central effluent treatment \nplant with reverse osmosis to treat and recycle effluents in steelmaking \nprocesses. The treated effluents are reused for low-end applications like coke \nquenching, blast furnace slag granulation, steel slag quenching, sinter/pellet \nmixing, gas cleaning plant, horticulture, and dust suppression, etc.\nFinancial \nimplications Negative\nA4.\t Energy Efficiency/Energy Management\nOpportunity Rationale for identifying the risk/\nopportunity\nTata Steel’s Initiatives\nSteelmaking is a highly energy-intensive \nprocess. Tata Steel fulfils its energy \nrequirements through multiple sources: \ncoal, natural gas, electricity, and other fossil \nfuels. Energy efficiency and management \ninitiatives help Tata Steel to manage and \noptimise energy consumption across its \noperations, resulting in lower operational \ncosts, greater resilience in the event of \nenergy disruptions, and a greater ability to \nrespond to regulatory obligations. \nEnergy efficiency and adoption of \nrenewable energy is also a key lever for \nTata Steel to lower its Scope 2 greenhouse \ngas emissions.\nTata Steel has several initiatives to improve energy efficiency of the Company across \nall geographies, and already recovers a large part of its process gases to produce \npower and for heating purposes at all its geographies.\nTata Steel is also working with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in India to identify and \nimplement energy efficiency projects across various sites in India.\nAs a milestone towards achieving Net Zero carbon emissions, Tata Steel has entered \ninto a definitive agreement with Tata Power to source 379 MW of captive renewable \npower, which will reduce 50 million tonnes of carbon emissions over the contract \nperiod of 25 years.\nTata Steel also commissioned a floating solar power project with a capacity of 10.8 \nMWp (Megawatt peak) on its upper cooling pond in the plant bringing the total \ncapacity to 20.34 MWp solar projects in the Jamshedpur plant. The Kalinganagar \nplant also has a floating solar plant with a capacity of 10.10 MWp.\nIn the Netherlands, Tata Steel, in alignment with the local ‘Noordzeekanaalgebied’ \nEnvironmental Agency, has developed an energy savings agenda for 2024-2027, \nyielding 50+ projects across the site.\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel Nederland reported 0.63 PJ of energy savings, equivalent \nto 175 million kWh, or the electricity consumption of over 70,000 households. The \nbiggest saving was achieved by a new, more efficient Hot Strip Mill furnace, saving \nan annual 0.575 PJ or 160 million kWh.\nFinancial \nimplications Positive \n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n162\nStatutory Reports\n"

Turnover was  \nH1,40,987 crore (previous year: H1,42,913 crore), which \nwas marginally lower against the previous year mainly \ndue to decline in steel prices, partly offset by higher \ndeliveries. EBITDA was at H31,004 crore (previous year:  \nH28,753 crore), higher by 8% than that of the previous \nyear, primarily on account of increase in deliveries \nand lower raw material cost, mainly coking coal and \npurchased pellets, partly offset by decline in steel prices. \nDuring the year under review, the crude steel production \nin Tata Steel Limited increased by 2% to 20.12 MT on \naccount of de-bottlenecking at sites.\n\t\n\u0007NINL achieved crude steel production of 0.66 MT, while \ndeliveries stood at 0.65 MT, both higher than previous \nyear by 0.46 MT and 0.48 MT respectively, due to full \nyear of operation. The turnover at H5,505 crore was \nsignificantly higher on account of higher deliveries partly \noffset by decline in steel prices.

The \ndecarbonisation of the business will be \nimplemented in two phases with one \nblast furnace being replaced before \n2030 and the second one thereafter. \nFor the first phase, we have \noutlined a plan to transition \nto green steel production \nby 2030 through the Direct \nReduced Iron (DRI) and electric \narc furnace route. \nThe DRI, set to initially operate on \nnatural gas, will seamlessly transition \nto hydrogen when it emerges as an \naccessible and economically feasible \nenergy source.

Reasonable assurance is a high \nlevel of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit \nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect \na material misstatement when it exists.

The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, \nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or \nthe override of internal control. \n•\t Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant \nto the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under \nSection 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible \nfor expressing our opinion on whether the Company \nhas adequate internal financial controls with reference \nto standalone financial statements in place and the \noperating effectiveness of such controls.\n•\t Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by management. \n•\t Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s \nuse of the going concern basis of accounting and, \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether \na material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the \nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern. \nIf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we \nare required to draw attention in our auditor’s report \nto the related disclosures in the standalone financial \nstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion.

(refer note 2(m), page F38).\n\t\n\u0007Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, \nright-of-use assets and intangible assets \n\t\n\u0007The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant \nand equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets \nat the end of each reporting period. This reassessment \nmay result in change in depreciation and amortisation \nexpense in future periods.

They \ninclude provisions on decommissioning, site restoration \nand environmental provisions as well which may change \nwhere changes in estimated reserves affect expectations \nabout the timing or cost of these activities. All provisions \nare reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to \nreflect the current best estimates. \n\t\n\u0007The Company uses significant judgements to assess \ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed \nwhen there is a possible obligation arising from past \nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed only \nby the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more \nuncertain future events not wholly within the control \nof the Company or a present obligation that arises from \npast event where it is either not probable that an outflow \nof resources will be utilised to settle the obligation or \na reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. \nContingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed \nin the financial statements. Further details are set out in \nnote 19, page F89 and note 34(A), page F105.\n\t\nFair value measurements of financial instruments \n\t\n\u0007When the fair value of financial assets and financial \nliabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be \nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, \ntheir fair value is measured using valuation techniques \nincluding Discounted Cash Flow Model. The inputs \nto these models are taken from observable markets \nwhere possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree \nof judgement is required in establishing fair values. \nJudgements include considerations of inputs such \nas liquidity risks, credit risks and volatility. Changes \nin assumptions about these factors could affect the \nreported fair value of financial instruments. Further \ndetails are set out in note 37, page F113. \n\t\nLeases \n\t\n\u0007The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to \nbe a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 “Leases”. \nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement in \nassessing the lease term including anticipated renewals \nand the applicable discount rate. \n\t\n\u0007The lease payments are discounted using the interest \nrate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily \ndetermined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, \nthe Company uses incremental borrowing rate. \n\t\nRetirement benefit obligations \n\t\n\u0007The Company’s retirement benefit obligations are \nsubject to a number of assumptions including discount \nrates, inflation, salary growth and mortality rate. \nSignificant assumptions are required when setting \nthese criteria and a change in these assumptions would \nhave a significant impact on the amount recorded in \nthe Company’s balance sheet and the statement of \nprofit and loss.

The ineffective portion of designated \nhedges is recognised immediately in the statement \nof profit and loss. \n\t\n\t\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n•\t for fair value hedges of recognised assets and \nliabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged \nassets and liabilities attributable to the risk being \nhedged, are recognised in the statement of \nprofit and loss and compensate for the effective \nportion of symmetrical changes in the fair value \nof the derivatives.\n•\t for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of \nthe change in the fair value of the derivative \nis recognised directly in other comprehensive \nincome and the ineffective portion is recognised \nin the statement of profit and loss. If the cash \nflow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted \ntransaction results in the recognition of a non-\nfinancial asset or liability, then, at the time the \nasset or liability is recognised, the associated \ngains or losses on the derivative that had \npreviously been recognised in equity are \nincluded in the initial measurement of the asset \nor liability. For hedges that do not result in the \nrecognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, \namounts deferred in equity are recognised in the \nstatement of profit and loss in the same period \nin which the hedged item affects the statement \nof profit and loss.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007In cases where hedge accounting is not applied, \nchanges in the fair value of derivatives are \nrecognised in the statement of profit and loss as \nand when they arise. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007Hedge accounting is discontinued when the \nhedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, \nor exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge \naccounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or \nloss on the hedging instrument recognised in \nequity is retained in equity until the forecasted \ntransaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no \nlonger expected to occur, the net cumulative gain \nor loss recognised in equity is transferred to the \nstatement of profit and loss for the period. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007Further details on the Company’s financial \ninstruments are set out in note 37, page F113.\n(n)\t Employee benefits\n\t\nDefined contribution plans \n\t\n\u0007Contributions under defined contribution plans are \nrecognised as expense for the period in which the \nemployee has rendered service.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable \nprofit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit \nas reported in the statement of profit and loss because \nit excludes items of income or expense that are taxable \nor deductible in other years and it further excludes items \nthat are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s \nliability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and \ntax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted \nin countries where the Company and its subsidiaries \noperate by the end of the reporting period. \n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or \nrecoverable on differences between the carrying value \nof assets and liabilities in the financial statements and \nthe corresponding tax bases used in the computation \nof taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance \nsheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally \nrecognised for all taxable temporary differences. In \ncontrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the \nextent that it is probable that future taxable profits will \nbe available against which the temporary differences can \nbe utilised.  \n\t\n\u0007The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at \nthe end of each reporting period and reduced to the \nextent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable \nprofits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to \nbe recovered. \n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected \nto apply in the period when the liability is settled or the \nasset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that \nhave been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of \nthe reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax \nliabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that \nwould follow from the manner in which the Company \nexpects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover \nor settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities. \n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the \nextent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax \nauthority and there are legally enforceable rights to set \noff current tax assets and current tax liabilities within \nthat jurisdiction. \n\t\n\u0007Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or \nincome in the statement of profit and loss, except when \nthey relate to items credited or debited either in other \ncomprehensive income or directly in equity, in which \ncase the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive \nincome or directly in equity.\n(t)\t\nRevenue\n\t\n\u0007The Company manufactures and sells a range of steel \nand other products. \n\t\nSale of products \n\t\n\u0007Revenue from sale of products is recognised when \ncontrol of the products has transferred, being when the \nproducts are delivered to the customer. Delivery occurs \nwhen the products have been shipped or delivered to the \nspecific location as the case may be, the risks of loss has \nbeen transferred, and either the customer has accepted \nthe products in accordance with the sales contract, or \nthe Company has objective evidence that all criteria for \nacceptance have been satisfied. Sale of products include \nrelated ancillary services, if any. \n\t\n\u0007Goods are often sold with volume and price discounts \nbased on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. \nRevenue from these sales is recognised based on the \nprice specified in the contract, net of the estimated \nvolume and price discounts. Accumulated experience is \nused to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the \nmost likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the \nextent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal \nwill not occur. A liability is recognised for expected \nvolume discounts payable to customers in relation to \nsales made until the end of the reporting period. No \nelement of financing is deemed present as the sales are \ngenerally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which \nis consistent with market practice. Any obligation to \nprovide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable \nis recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the \npoint in time that the consideration is unconditional \nbecause only the passage of time is required before the \npayment is due. \n\t\n\u0007The Company does not adjust the transaction prices for \nany time value of money in case of contracts where the \nperiod between the transfer of the promised goods or \nservices to the customer and payment by the customer \ndoes not exceed one year. \n2.\t Material accounting policies (Contd.)\nF42\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\nFinancial Statements\n"

The technology transition and investments are dependent on national and international policies and would also \nbe driven by the government decisions in the country of operation. Management’s assessment is that generally, these \npotential carbon reduction-related costs would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through \npublic spending/subsidies.\n\t\n\u0007On September 15, 2023, Tata Steel UK Limited (“TSUK”) which forms the main part of the UK Business, announced a joint \nagreement with the UK Government on a proposal to invest in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace (‘EAF’) steel making at \nthe Port Talbot site with a capital cost of £1.25 billion inclusive of a grant from the UK Government of up to £500 million, \nsubject to relevant regulatory approvals, information and consultation processes, and the finalisation of detailed terms \nand conditions. The proposal also includes a wider restructuring of other locations and functions across TSUK. \n\t\n\u0007As per local regulations in the UK, the National Consultation between TSUK and the UK multi trade union representative \nbody (UK Steel Committee) on the asset closure plan has now been concluded. Under the proposed re-structuring \nprogramme, Port Talbot’s two blast furnaces (No.5 and No.4) would get closed by end of June 2024 and latest by the end \nof September 2024 respectively. Following the closure of Blast Furnace No. 4, the remaining heavy end assets would wind \ndown and the Continuous Annealing Processing Line (CAPL) would close in March 2025. TSUK has also agreed that it would \ncontinue to operate the hot strip mill through the proposed transition period and in future.\n\t\n\u0007Given the risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with the underlying market and business conditions including \nhigher inflation, higher interest rates and supply chain disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, the uncommitted nature \nof available financing options and pending the finalisation of funding support from the UK Government for the proposed \nEAF investment, there exists a material uncertainty surrounding the impact of such adversities on the financial situation \nof TSUK.\n\t\n\u0007With respect to Tata Steel Netherland operations (TSN) which forms main part of the Mainland Europe (MLE) business, \ndiscussions with the government on the proposed decarbonisation roadmap have been initiated. The transition plan \nconsiders that the policy environment in the Netherlands and EU is supportive to the European steel industry and a level \nplaying field would be achieved by, either one or a combination of: a) Dutch Policy developments, b) Convergence with EU \non (fiscal) climate measures, enabling EU steel players to pass on costs and c) tailor made support mechanisms. In relation \nto the likely investments required for the de-carbonisation of TSN operations driven by regulatory changes in Europe and \nNetherlands, inter alia, the scenarios consider that the Dutch Government will provide a certain level of financial support \nto execute the decarbonisation strategy, which are being discussed between the Company/TSN and Dutch Government.\n\t\n\u0007Based on the above and other available measures, MLE business is expected to have adequate liquidity to meet its future \nbusiness requirements.\n\t\n\u0007The recoverable value of investments held in T Steel Holdings Pte. Ltd. (TSH), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company \nis dependent on the operational and financial performance of TSE, Tata Steel Minerals Canada (TSMC) and net assets of \nthe other underlying businesses.\n\t\n\u0007The recoverable value of TSE is based on fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) for TSUK and TSN, which inter -alia considers \nimpact of switching the heavy end and other relevant assets to a more “Green Steel” capex base. The fair value computation \nuses cash flow forecasts based on most recent financial budgets, strategic forecasts and future projections taking the \nanalysis out into perpetuity based on a steady state, sustainable cash flow reflecting average steel industry conditions \nbetween successive peaks and troughs of profitability.\n\t\n\u0007Key assumptions for the fair value less cost to sell model relate to expected changes to selling prices and raw material \n& conversion costs, EU steel demand, energy costs, exchange rates, the amount of capital expenditure needed for \ndecarbonisation, changes to EBITDA resulting from producing and selling steel with low embedded CO2 emissions, levels \nF59\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n"

The projections are based on the both past performance \nand the expectations of future performance assumptions therein. The Company estimates discount rates using post-tax \nrates that reflect the current market rates adjusted to reflect the way the European Union steel market would assess the \nspecific risk. The weighted average post-tax discount rates used for discounting the cash flows projections is in the range \nof 8.20% - 9.11% (March 31, 2023: 7.90% to 8.80%). Beyond the specifically forecasted period, a growth rate in the range \nof Nil - 2.00% (March 31, 2023:1.70% - 2.00%) is used to extrapolate the cash flow projections. This rate does not exceed \nthe average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.\n\t\n\u0007The Company has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests including sensitivity in respect of discount rates. \nIf any of the key assumptions change, there is a risk that the headroom in the model would reduce and that the reduction \nin the headroom could lead to impairments of carrying amount of investments in TSH. However, the Company believes \nthat key assumptions represent the most likely impact from decarbonisation at this point in time. Going forward, the key \nassumptions would be kept under review for changes, if any, based on the progress of the discussions with the government \nand regulators on the decarbonisation plan.\n\t\n\u0007Based on above, the Company carried out an impairment assessment of its investments held in TSH, which in turn \nholds investments in TSE, and recognised an impairment loss of ₹10,038.00 crore during the year in the standalone \nfinancial statements.\n(iv)\t \u0007The Company, through erstwhile Tata Steel Long Products Limited (“TSLP”) now merged with the Company, on July 4, \n2022, completed the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (“NINL”). As on March 31, 2024, the total investment of \nthe Company in NINL is ₹14,196.82 crore.\n\t\n\u0007The recoverable value of such exposure in NINL has been assessed at fair value less costs to sell using cash flow forecasts \nbased on the most recently approved business plan for financial year 2024-25. Beyond financial year 2024-25, the cash \nflow forecasts is based on strategic forecasts which cover a period of eight years and future projections taking the analysis \nout to perpetuity. It also includes capital expenditure for capacity expansion of steel making facilities from the current 1.1 \nMTPA to 4.95 MTPA by financial year 2029-30 as well as estimated EBITDA changes due to implementation of the expansion \nstrategy and operating the assets.\n\t\n\u0007Key assumptions to the fair value less costs to sell model are changes to selling prices and raw material costs, steel demand, \namount of capital expenditure needed for expansion of the existing facilities, EBITDA and post-tax discount rate of 10.10% \n(March 31, 2023: 10.10%). The estimates are based on management’s best estimate of implementing the expansion strategy.\n\t\n\u0007For the fair value less costs to sell model, a terminal growth rate of 4.00% (March 31, 2023: 4.00%) has been used to \nextrapolate the cash flows beyond the specifically forecasted period.\n\t\n\u0007The outcome of the impairment assessment as on March 31, 2024 for investments held in NINL has not resulted in any \nimpairment of investments.\n\t\n\u0007The management has conducted sensitivity analysis including sensitivity in respect of discount rates, on the impairment \nassessment of the carrying value of investments held in NINL. The management believes that no reasonably possible \nchange in any of the key assumptions used in the model would cause the carrying value of investments to materially \nexceed its recoverable value.\n6.\t Investments (Contd.)\n\t\n[Item No. I(g)(i) and II(b)(i), Page F26]\nF60\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\nFinancial Statements\n"

      "text": "NOTES\nforming part of the standalone financial statements\n35.\tOther significant litigations\n(a)\t\n\u0007Odisha Legislative Assembly issued an amendment to \nIndian Stamp Act, 1889, on May 9, 2013 and inserted a new \nprovision (Section 3A) in respect of stamp duty payable \non grant/renewal of mining leases. As per the amended \nprovision, stamp duty is levied equal to 15% of the average \nroyalty that would accrue out of the highest annual \nextraction of minerals under the approved mining plan \nmultiplied by the period of such mining lease. The Company \nhad filed a writ petition challenging the constitutionality of \nthe Act on July 5, 2013. The Hon’ble High Court, Cuttack \npassed an order on July 9, 2013 granting interim stay on \nthe operation of the Amendment Act, 2013. Because of the \nstay, as on date, the Act is not enforceable and any demand \nreceived by the Company is not liable to be proceeded \nwith. Meanwhile, the Company received demand notices \nfor the various mines at Odisha totalling to ₹5,579.00 \ncrore (March 31, 2023: ₹5,579.00 crore). The Company has \nconcluded that it is remote that the claim will sustain on \nultimate resolution of the legal case by the court.\n\t\n\u0007In April 2015, the Company has received an intimation \nfrom Government of Odisha, granting extension of validity \nperiod for leases under the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 \nup to March 31,2030 in respect of eight mines and up \nto March 31, 2020 for two mines subject to execution of \nsupplementary lease deed. Liability has been provided \nin the books of accounts as on March 31, 2020 as per the \nexisting provisions of the Stamp Act 1899 and the Company \nhad paid the stamp duty and registration charges totalling \n₹413.72 crore for supplementary deed execution in respect \nof eight mines out of the above mines.\n(b)\t\n\u0007Noamundi Iron Ore Mine of the Company was due for \nits third renewal with effect from January 01, 2012. The \napplication for renewal was submitted by the Company \nwithin the stipulated time, but it remained pending \nconsideration with the State and the mining operations \nwere continued in terms of the prevailing law.\n\t\n\u0007By a judgement of April 2014 in the case of Goa Mines, the \nSupreme Court took a view that second and subsequent \nrenewal of mining lease can be effected once the State \nconsiders the application and decides to renew the mining \nlease by issuing an express order. State of Jharkhand issued \nrenewal order to the Company on December 31, 2014. The \nState, however, took a view on interpretation of Goa Mines \njudgement that the mining carried out after expiry of the \nperiod of second renewal was ‘illegal’ and hence, issued a \ndemand notice of ₹3,568.31 crore being the price of iron \nore extracted. The said demand has been challenged by \nthe Company before the Jharkhand High Court. \n\t\n\u0007The mining operations were suspended from August 1, \n2014. Upon issuance of an express order, Company paid \n₹152.00 crore under protest, so that mining can be resumed. \n\t\n\u0007The Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation \n(MMDR) Amendment Ordinance, 2015 promulgated on \nJanuary 12, 2015 provides for extension of such mining \nleases whose applications for renewal have remained \npending with the State(s). Based on the new Ordinance, \nJharkhand Government revised the Express Order on \nFebruary 12, 2015 for extending the period of lease up to \nMarch 31, 2030 with the following terms and conditions:\n•\t value of iron ore produced by alleged unlawful \nmining during the period January 1, 2012 to April 20, \n2014 for ₹2,994.49 crore to be decided on the basis of \ndisposal of our writ petition before Hon’ble High Court \nof Jharkhand.\n•\t value of iron ore produced from April 21, 2014 to July 17, \n2014 amounting to ₹421.83 crore to be paid in maximum \n3 instalments.\n•\t value of iron ore produced from July 18, 2014 to August \n31, 2014 i.e. ₹152.00 crore to be paid immediately.\n\t\n\u0007District Mining Officer Chaibasa on March 16, 2015 \nissued a demand notice for payment of ₹421.83 crore, in \nthree monthly instalments. The Company on March 20, \n2015 replied that since the lease has been extended by \napplication of law till March 31, 2030, the above demand \nis not tenable. The Company, has paid ₹50.00 crore under \nprotest on July 27, 2015, because the State had stopped \nissuance of transit permits. \n\t\n\u0007The Company filed another writ petition before the Hon’ble \nHigh Court of Jharkhand which was heard on September 9, \n2015. An interim order was given by the Hon’ble High Court \nof Jharkhand on September 17, 2015 wherein the Court \nhas directed the Company to pay the amount of ₹371.83 \ncrore in 3 equal instalments, first instalment by October 15, \n2015, second instalment by November 15, 2015 and third \ninstalment by December 15, 2015. \n\t\n\u0007In view of the interim order of the Hon’ble High Court of \nJharkhand ₹124.00 crore was paid on September 28, 2015, \n₹124.00 crore on November 12, 2015 and ₹123.83 crore on \nDecember 14, 2015 under protest. \nF110\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\nFinancial Statements\n"

This positively impacts \nthe steel industry, which showed 14% \ngrowth in finished steel demand in \nFY2023-24 over FY2022-23. Higher steel \nexports from China led to softening \nprices in the international market, \nthereby lowering the profitability of \nIndian mills. The European steel industry, \nalready grappling with weak domestic \ndemand, also felt the heat of cheap steel \nimports.\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel Limited \ncompleted the amalgamation of 5 Indian \nsubsidiary companies. Please refer to the \nsection 'Forging a Stronger Future' on \nthe following page.\nGeneration of capital - \nPerformance for FY2023-24\nTata Steel, during FY2023-24 \ngenerated a consolidated revenue of \n₹2,29,171 crore (as compared to PY \n₹2,43,353 crore) and a consolidated \nEBITDA of ₹23,402 crore (as compared \nKey highlights in FY2023-24\nTata Steel prioritises strategic capital \nTata Steel prioritises strategic capital \nallocation, drives operational efficiency, and \nallocation, drives operational efficiency, and \nmanages debt effectively to ensure long-term \nmanages debt effectively to ensure long-term \nsustainable returns for its stakeholders.\nsustainable returns for its stakeholders.\nB20,301 crore\nCash flow from operations  \nB77,550 crore\nNet Debt\nto PY ₹32,698 crore). The Company’s \nconsolidated cash flow from operations \nstood at ₹20,301 crore. Considering \nthe performance, the Board has \nrecommended a dividend of ₹3.60 per \nOrdinary (Equity) Share. \nIn India, the Shikhar25 programme \ndrove savings and value protection of \naround ₹6,821 crore, while in Europe, \nimprovement programmes yielded \nsavings of €124 million for Tata Steel in \nthe Netherlands and £48 million in the \nUK. A sustained focus on balance sheet \nand cost optimisation aids Tata Steel's \nstrategic objective, helping it retain its \nposition as a global cost leader.\nAs part of fund-raising, the Company \nissued and allotted Unsecured, Rated, \nListed, Redeemable, Non-Convertible \nDebentures (NCDs) aggregating to \n₹2,700 crore, to identified investors on a \nprivate placement basis.\nDuring the year, Moody’s upgraded \nTata Steel’s credit rating from ‘Ba1’ \nPositive to ‘Baa3’ Stable, while S&P \nretained the ‘BBB-’ rating. Domestic \nrating agencies have rated Tata Steel \n‘AA+’, indicating a strong credit profile \nand operating performance. With \nthis, Tata Steel is the only Indian steel \ncompany which is currently rated \ninvestment grade by both international \nand domestic credit rating agencies. \nDeployment of capital - \nInvestments for growth and \nsustainability\nCapacity augmentation to leverage \nIndia’s growth potential is key to \nstrengthening Tata Steel’s leadership \nposition in chosen segments. In \nthe past decade, the Company has \ndoubled its steel production capacity \nthrough organic and inorganic routes \nand has outlined plans to reach \n40 MTPA capacity in India. \nIn FY2023-24 Tata Steel accelerated \ncapital expenditure towards the \nKalinganagar 5 MTPA capacity \nexpansion and 2.2 MTPA CRM Complex \nproject. Out of the total consolidated \ncapital expenditure of ₹18,207 \ncrore, it allocated over ₹5,300 crore \nfor these projects with the second \nblast furnace at Kalinganagar now \nin the process of commissioning in \nFY2024-25. €550 million were spent \non the relining of the Blast Furnace 6 \nat IJmuiden, to prolong the life of the \nasset and improve its efficiency. The \nCompany also spent over €168 million \non the various sustainability projects \nin the Netherlands. ₹1,400+ crore \nexpenditure went towards mining \ncapacity expansion in India.\nThe Company is setting up a \n0.75 MTPA scrap-based electric arc \nfurnace facility in Ludhiana, Punjab, \nIndia. Tata Steel has also invested \nin particulate matter emissions \nreduction in the Netherlands. In \nSeptember 2023, Tata Steel and the \nUK Government announced a joint \nagreement on a proposal to invest in \na state-of-the-art electric arc furnace \nsteel manufacturing facility at the \nPort Talbot site with a capital cost of \n£1.25 billion inclusive of a grant from \nthe UK Government of up to £500 \nmillion. In the UK, Tata Steel plans to \nshut down both blast furnaces in 2024 \nand has started working towards the \nproposed transition to EAF-based \nlow CO2 steelmaking. The Company’s \nUK business incurred an EBITDA \nloss of £364 million in FY2023-24. \nThough the transition would lead to \nredundancy and restructuring costs \nand losses in the ongoing operations \nin FY2024-25, the business is expected \nto stabilise by the end of FY2024-25. \nBaa3 (Stable)\nRating upgrade by Moody \nfrom Ba1 (positive) \nValue Creation\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n73\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n72\nFinancial Capital\n"

      "text": "average revenue per tonne along with lower deliveries. \nTSE reported an EBITDA loss of H7,612 crore during \nFY2023-24 lower than the EBITDA profit of H4,632 crore \nduring FY2022-23. This significant reduction in EBITDA \nwas seen in both TSN and TSUK. In TSN the impact of \nthe Blast Furnace 6 reline and lower spreads within \nthe market contributed for the decline whereas in \nTSUK the performance was adversely impacted by the \nperformance of the end of life assets at the Port Talbot \nsite as well as subdued market conditions.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel Nederlands (‘TSN’) – Liquid steel production \nat IJmuiden Steel Works, Netherlands during FY2023-24 \nat 4.81 MT was 1.52 MT lower than the previous year \ndue to the reline of Blast Furnace 6. With completion of \nthe repairs that were scheduled in the outage, the Blast \nFurnace 6 will be able to stay in production until TSN is \nready to transition to a whole new way of producing steel \nand the newly built DRI plant is commissioned.\n\t\n\u0007In October 2022, TSN submitted a request for ‘Maatwerk’ \nto enable the first phase of its decarbonisation plan, \nwhich is to be completed by 2030. An improved Green \nSteel Plan with an enhanced focus on reducing the impact \non the environment and making TSN more circular was \nsubmitted to the Dutch Government in November 2023. \nThe Green Steel Plan entails the closing of the largest \nblast furnace (blast furnace 7) and cokes and gas plant 2 \nand replacing them with a direct reduced iron plant and \nan electric arc furnace.\n\t\n\u0007The Green Steel Plan is contingent on receiving \n‘Maatwerk’ support. External advisors, engaged by \nthe Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy to \nassess TSN’s Green Steel Plan against alternatives viewed \nfrom the perspective and policy choices of the State.  \nThe report came out on March 28, 2024 and describes \n5 scenarios. The cabinet has indicated in its letter of the \nsame date to Parliament that it will investigate as quickly \nas possible if they can start discussions with TSN based \nupon the Green Steel Plan with accelerated reduction \nof nuisance.\n\t\n\u0007With the continued support of Tata Steel, and the \nincreased urgency to reduce our environmental impact, \nTSN is confident that in the coming year TSN will \naccelerate the process towards concluding a ‘Maatwerk’ \nsupport package. In the meantime, the process to obtain \npermits for the new facilities has started and TSN is \nactively engaging with local communities to inform on \nTSN plans and seek feedback.\n\t\n\u0007In FY2023-24, the Roadmap Plus Program took a big step \nforward with completion of the dust removal installation \nand start of constructing the DeNOx installation, both at \nthe Pellet Plant. The DeNOx installation aims to reduce \nnitrogen oxide emissions by 80% by capturing NOx \ncompounds at the Pellet Plant.\n\t\n\u0007With the Green Steel Plan, TSN is at the threshold of an \nimportant transition. To be able to afford that plan, it \nis essential to have and maintain a strong competitive \nposition and to be agile enough to respond to rapidly \nchanging circumstances and new developments.  \nIn FY2023-24 an initiative that focusses on improving \nthe operational and financial performance of Tata Steel \nIJmuiden was launched under the name ‘TSIJ.NU’. The \ninitiative aimed to increase throughput and utilise the full \nproduct portfolio resulting from the latest investments \nand the measures taken consist of improving our market \nposition, reducing various fixed costs and working \ntowards stable production.\n\t\n\u0007In the year under review, TSN completed the upgrade \nof its Continuous Galvanising Line 3, that enables \na more robust production of advanced (ultra) high \nstrength steels with increased dimensional windows, \nand the extensive upgrade of Cold Mill 21, that allows \nus to manufacture grades, such as existing and future \nadvanced and ultra-high strength steels, at significantly \nlarger dimensional windows, improved surface quality, \nimproved thickness performance, and a better surface \ninspection to improve the customer performance.\n\t\n\u0007Tata Steel UK (‘TSUK’) – Liquid steel production at Port \nTalbot Steel Works, Wales during FY2023-24 at 2.99 MT \nwas marginally lower over the previous year. During both \nyears TSUK’s primary steel making assets in Port Talbot \nproduced significantly below their planned outputs \ndue to operational issues with the assets which were \nnear the end of their useful lives. These operational \nissues contributed to the closure of the coke ovens in  \nMarch 2024 and towards a strategic review of the \nremainder of the heavy end assets in Port Talbot.\n\t\n\u0007The Drive to Save programme was developed and \nlaunched at the start of the year to focus on the cash \nposition on the business. The programme delivered \nimportant savings with £56m in cash improvements \nin first half of FY2023-24. There were a number of \nimprovement implemented with the aim of maximising \nvalue from TSUK’s downstream assets. These included \nthe installation of the UK’s largest and heaviest slitter at \nHartlepool, a new welder at the Automotive Finishing \nLine at Llanwern which has increased gauge and coating \nweight capability and new drossing robots improving \nthe zinc yield at the Zodiac Plant at Llanwern and making \nthe operation safer for employees.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n279\n"

The instruments are confined \nprincipally to forward foreign exchange contracts, \nforward rate agreements, cross currency swaps, \ninterest rate swaps and collars. The instruments are \nemployed as hedges of transactions included in the \nfinancial statements or for highly probable forecast \ntransactions/firm contractual commitments. These \nderivatives contracts do not generally extend \nbeyond six months, except for certain currency \nswaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Derivatives are initially accounted for and measured \nat fair value on the date the derivative contract is \nentered into and are subsequently remeasured to \ntheir fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Group adopts hedge accounting for forward \nforeign exchange, interest rate and commodity \ncontracts, wherever possible. At the inception \nof each hedge, there is a formal, documented \ndesignation of the hedging relationship. This \ndocumentation includes, inter alia, items such as \nidentification of the hedged item and transaction \nand nature of the risk being hedged. At inception \neach hedge is expected to be highly effective \nin achieving an offset of changes in fair value or \ncash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The \neffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the \nrisk associated with the exposure being hedged \nis assessed and measured at the inception and \non an ongoing basis. The ineffective portion of \ndesignated hedges is recognised immediately in \nthe consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\t\n\t\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n•\t for fair value hedges of recognised assets and \nliabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged \nassets and liabilities attributable to the risk being \nhedged, are recognised in the consolidated \nstatement of profit and loss and compensate for \nthe effective portion of symmetrical changes in \nthe fair value of the derivatives.\n•\t for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of \nthe change in the fair value of the derivative \nis recognised directly in other comprehensive \nincome and the ineffective portion is recognised \nin the consolidated statement of profit and loss. \nIf the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or \nforecasted transaction results in the recognition \nof a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the \ntime the asset or liability is recognised, the \nassociated gains or losses on the derivative that \nhad previously been recognised in equity are \nincluded in the initial measurement of the asset \nor liability. For hedges that do not result in the \nrecognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, \namounts deferred in equity are recognised in the \nconsolidated statement of profit and loss in the \nsame period in which the hedged item affects \nthe consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007In cases where hedge accounting is not applied, \nchanges in the fair value of derivatives are \nrecognised in the consolidated statement of profit \nand loss as and when they arise.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging \ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, \nor no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

The production increased at Tata \nSteel Limited to 20.12 MT which was higher by 2% \n(FY2022-23: 19.67 MT) attributable to de-bottlenecking \nacross sites. Tata Steel Europe (‘TSE’) produced  \n7.80 MT, lower by 17% (FY2022-23: 9.35 MT) due \nto the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands \nalong with subdued market demand. NINL produced  \n0.66 MT (FY2022-23: 0.20 MT), as it commenced \nproduction from October 2022 onwards post takeover \nof its operations by the Company. Production at  \nSouth-East Asia (‘SEA’) of 1.36 MT (FY2022-23: 1.43 MT) \nwas lower due to weak demand. The consolidated steel \ndeliveries of TSG was at 29.39 MT in FY2023-24 as against  \n28.79 MT in FY2022-23, increase of 2% primarily at Tata \nSteel Standalone (1.06 MT). Deliveries declined at TSE  \non account of the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in \nthe Netherlands.\n\t\n\u0007The turnover of TSG in FY2023-24 at H2,29,171 crore was \nlower over FY2022-23 by H14,182 crore (6%) on account \nof decline in steel realisations across geographies along \nwith decline in deliveries at the European operations \nattributable to decrease in demand and lower \nproduction, partly offset by higher deliveries in India.\n\t\n\u0007The EBITDA in FY2023-24 at H23,402 crore was lower \nover FY2022-23 by H9,296 crore (28%), due to subdued \nperformance from the European operations on account \nof contraction in steel prices and lower deliveries. EBITDA \nhowever, improved in the Indian operations on account of \nhigher deliveries by 1.06 MT along with decrease in input \ncosts, which was partly offset by lower steel realisations.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n228\nStatutory Reports\n"

Global central banks have \nbeen focused on inflation and as policy transmission \nsustained, it has reflected in the inflation trajectory across \nkey regions. Looking ahead to 2025, the Global GDP is \nexpected to witness a marginal increase to 3.2% y-o-y. \nGlobal outlook for 2024–25 reflects better prospects for \ndeveloped economies including U.S. even as developing \neconomies like India remain resilient. China continues \nto be a key watchpoint, with its heavily indebted real \nestate market weighing on economic recovery. China \nGovernment has fixed its official growth target at around \n5% and has also pledged to create 12 million jobs amidst \ngrowing concerns over rising unemployment.\n\t\n\u0007Overall, the chances of a hard landing for global economy \nhave diminished due to disinflation and steady growth in \nselect regions. As a result, risks to global growth are also \nbroadly balanced. For instance, on the upside, expansive \nfiscal policy and continued disinflation can boost growth \nbut raise the risk of a more costly adjustment later on. \nConversely, commodity price spikes due to geopolitical \nissues such as Red Sea attacks may result in persistent \ninflation and lead to prolonged tighter monetary \npolicy. Hence, in the near term, global policymakers \nfocus will be on effectively managing inflation while \npromoting growth.\n\t\n\u0007In India, The Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) expects GDP \nto grow close to 8% y-o-y in 2024, higher than 7.2% \ny-o-y recorded in 2023. Domestic economic activity \nhas been aided by Government spending, household \nconsumption, rise in manufacturing activity and services \nsector. These factors along with healthy corporate and \nbank balance sheets and rising integration with global \nsupply chains are likely to aid growth in the near term. \nIn 2025, India GDP is expected to expand by 7.4% y-o-y \nand Consumer Price Index (‘CPI’) is likely to moderate \nfrom 5.4% in 2024 to 4.5% levels. Inflation trajectory to be \nshaped by evolving food inflation, state of supply chains \nand global commodity prices especially oil.\n\t\nFinancial Markets:\n\t\n\u0007Global financial markets have continued to remain \nvolatile and uncertain due to inflation – rate hike \ndynamics. In the U.S., sharp rise in interest rates, since \nFebruary 2022, have led to a situation where short-term \nU.S. Treasury yields have surpassed those of longer-term \nU.S. Treasury bonds, creating an inverted yield curve. \nMoreover, persistent inflation and the ongoing rate hikes \nby the U.S. Federal Reserve have continued to weigh on \nthe global credit market, culminating in benchmark rates \nfor U.S. Treasuries reaching their highest levels in 16 years \n(by October 2023). Since then, slight decline in the CPI \nand signs of a cooling labour market in the U.S. have led \nto improved sentiment.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\n287\n"

Growth across \nthe EU was uneven across the individual economies. \nGermany experienced a mild recession with -0.1% and \nFrance and Italy grew by 0.9% and 0.7% respectively.\n\t\n\u0007Global steel demand declined in 2023 for the second year \nin a row by 1.1%, in line with the weak macro-economic \nconditions, after -3.3% decline in 2022. Demand in \nChina decreased by 3.3% (2022: -2.9%). This decline was \nmainly driven by the downturn in the Chinese real estate \nsector. Steel demand from the manufacturing sectors \ncontinued to grow. Chinese steel demand is gradually \nshifting from construction to manufacturing and from \nlong steel products to flat steel products. Demand in the \nEU decreased by 10.0% (2022: -7.9%). Activity growth in \nthe main steel-using sectors decelerated but remained \nslightly positive in 2023. Although construction output \nwas negatively impacted by the high interest rates, \nespecially for real estate, automotive output grew \nstrongly due to backlogs.\n\t\n\u0007In 2023 global steel production decreased by 0.2% \nto 1,848 Mt (2022: -3.3%). Steel production in China \ndecreased by 0.4% to 1,015 Mt (2022: -1.4%) and equated \nto 55% of global steel production. In the EU, production \ndecreased by 7.3% to 126 Mt (2022: -10.7%) as ~20% of \nblast furnaces were idled in response to lower demand \nfor steel.\n\t\n\u0007The market reference price for iron ore fines (China CFR \n62%) remained relatively stable in 2023 at US$120/t  \n(change against the previous year: -$1/t), with a low of \nUS$105/t in May and a high of US$137/t in December. \nThe hard coking coal spot price (Australia FOB) declined \nto US$296/t (change against the previous year: -$69/t). \nIn March 2022 the price was at an all-time high of 594 \nUS$/t due to the loss of supply from Russia as a result of \nthe war in the Ukraine. The German benchmark scrap \nprice (Sorte 2/8) decreased to €340/t (change against \nthe previous year: -€74/t) compared to the previous \ncalendar year. The price of CO2 increased in 2023 to  \n€84/t (change against the previous year: +€3/t), reaching \nan all-time high in February 2023 at €92/t. Reforms of the \nEU Emissions Trading System lead to a reduction in the \nsupply of permits which cause the price to rise.\n\t\n\u0007In the second half of 2023 the price declined mainly \ndue to the weak economy reducing the demand for \ncarbon allowances.\n\t\n\u0007The European steel spot Hot Rolled Coil price (Germany, \nparity point) decreased in 2022 to €713/t (-€193/t). \nIn April 2022 the steel price was at an all-time high of  \n€1,346/t due to the loss of supply from Ukraine and \nRussia. In 2023 the price was relatively low due to \ndeclining demand for steel.\n\t\n\u0007In 2024 economic growth is expected to gradually \naccelerate in both the EU and the UK due to a lowering \nof the bank rates as inflation normalises. However, \nthe high interest rates will continue to impact the \neconomy leading to a gradual recovery. In 2024 growth \nof 0.8% is expected for the EU and 0.5% for the UK. \nEconomic growth is expected to return to long-term \nlevels pre-pandemic in 2026. Output growth in the  \nsteel-using sectors is forecast to be low in 2024 due to the \ntight monetary policy. A recovery in real demand is not \nforeseen in 2024 but a rebound of steel demand of 2.9% \nis expected due to restocking as the steel-using sectors \nstart to anticipate higher demand for their products.\n\t\n\u0007The turnover and profit/(loss) figures of TSE are \ngiven below:\n(H crore)\nFY24\nFY23\nTurnover\n78,144\n90,300\nEBITDA\n(7,612)\n4,632\nProfit before tax (PBT), before \nexceptional\n(12,555)\n1,103\nProfit before tax (PBT)\n(19,262)\n1,304\nProfit after tax (PAT), before exceptional\n(12,896)\n(3,464)\nProfit after tax (PAT)\n(19,603)\n(3,263)\nThe production and sales performance of TSE (continuing \noperations) is given below:\n(mn tonnes)\nFY24\nFY23\nChange (%)\nLiquid Steel Production\n7.80 \n9.35\n(17)\nDeliveries\n7.68\n8.16\n(6)\n\t\n\u0007Production in FY2023-24 decreased by 1.55 MT (17%) \ncompared to the previous year due to the reline of Blast \nFurnace 6 in the Netherlands.

Judgment is required to assess the impact of \nsuch changes on the measurement of these assets and \nthe time frame for their utilisation. The Group reviews the \ncarrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each \nreporting period. The policy has been detailed in note 2(t) \npage F163 and its further information are set out in note \n12, page F186.\n\t\nProvisions and contingent liabilities\n\t\n\u0007A provision is recognised when the Group has a present \nobligation, legal or constructive, as result of a past event and \nit is probable that the outflow of resources will be required to \nsettle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate \ncan be made. They include provisions on decommissioning, \nsite restoration and environmental provisions as well which \nmay change where changes in estimated reserves affect \nexpectations about the timing or cost of these activities. \nAll provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and \nadjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n\t\n\u0007The Group uses significant judgements to assess \ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed \nwhen there is a possible obligation arising from past \nevents, the existence of which will be confirmed only \nby the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more \nuncertain future events not wholly within the control of \nthe Group or a present obligation that arises from past \nevent where it is either not probable that an outflow \nof resources will be utilised to settle the obligation \nor a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. \nContingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in \nthe consolidated financial statements. Further details are \nset out in note 24, page F213 and note 37(A), page F235.\n\t\nFair value measurements of financial instruments\n\t\n\u0007When the fair value of financial assets and financial \nliabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be \nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, their \nfair value is measured using valuation techniques including \nDiscounted Cash Flow Model. The inputs to these models \nare taken from observable markets where possible, \nbut where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is \nrequired in establishing fair values. Judgements include \nconsiderations of inputs such as liquidity risks, credit risks \nand volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors \ncould affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. \nFurther details are set out in note 40, page F243.\n\t\nLeases\n\t\n\u0007The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be \na lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 “Leases”. \nIdentification of a lease requires significant judgement in \nassessing the lease term including anticipated renewals \nand the applicable discount rate.\n\t\n\u0007The lease payments are discounted using the interest \nrate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily \ndetermined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, \nthe Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\t\nRetirement benefit obligations and assets\n\t\n\u0007The Group’s retirement benefit obligations are subject \nto a number of assumptions including discount rates, \ninflation, salary growth and mortality rate. Significant \nassumptions are required when setting these criteria and \na change in these assumptions would have a significant \nimpact on the amount recorded in the Group’s balance \nsheet and the consolidated statement of profit and \nloss. The Group sets these assumptions based on \nprevious experience and third party actuarial advice. \nThe assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted \nfollowing actuarial and experience changes.

The carrying values of \nassets acquired are determined based on estimate of a \nvaluation carried out by independent professional valuers \nappointed by the Group. The values have been assessed \nbased on the technical estimates of useful lives of tangible \nassets and benefits expected from the use of intangible \nassets. Other assets and liabilities were recorded at values \nthat were expected to be realised or settled respectively.\n(d)\t Basis of consolidation\n\t\n\u0007The consolidated financial statements incorporate \nthe financial statements of the Company and entities \ncontrolled by the Company i.e. its subsidiaries. It also \nincludes the Group’s share of profits, net assets and \nretained post acquisition reserves of joint arrangements \nand associates that are consolidated using the equity or \nproportionate method of consolidation, as applicable.\n\t\n\u0007Control is achieved when the Company is exposed to, \nor has rights to the variable returns of the entity and the \nability to affect those returns through its power to direct \nthe relevant activities of the entity.\n\t\n\u0007Associates are those companies over which the Company \nhas the ability to exercise significant influence on the \nfinancial and operating policy decisions, which it does \nnot control. Generally, significant influence is presumed \nto exist when the Company holds more than 20% of the \nvoting rights. Joint arrangements, which include joint \nventures and joint operations, are those over whose \nactivities the Company has joint control, typically under \na contractual arrangement. In joint ventures, the Group \nexercises joint control and has rights to the net assets of \nthe arrangement. The investment is accounted for under \nthe equity method and therefore recognised at cost at \nthe date of acquisition and subsequently adjusted for \nthe Group’s share in undistributed earnings or losses \nsince acquisition, less any impairment incurred. When \nthe Group’s share of losses exceeds the carrying value \nof such investments, the carrying value is reduced to Nil \nand recognition of future losses is discontinued, except \nto the extent that the Group has incurred obligation in \nrespect of the associate/ joint venture.\n\t\n\u0007The results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and \nassociates acquired or disposed off during the year are \nincluded in the consolidated statement of profit and \nloss from the effective date of acquisition or up to the \neffective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n\t\n\u0007Intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses \nare eliminated on consolidation.\n\t\n\u0007Non-controlling interests represent the portion of \nprofit or loss and net assets not held by the Group \nand are presented separately in the consolidated \nfinancial statements.\n(e)\t Business combinations\n\t\n\u0007Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted \nfor using the acquisition method. The consideration \ntransferred in each business combination is measured at \nthe aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets \ntransferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former \nowners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the \nGroup in exchange for control of the acquiree.\n\t\n\u0007Acquisition related costs are recognised in the \nconsolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\t\n\u0007Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an \nasset and measured at cost, being the excess of the \nconsideration transferred in the business combination \nover the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the \nidentifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and \ncontingent liabilities recognised, as applicable. Where \nthe fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities \nexceed the cost of acquisition, after re-assessing the fair \nvalues of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the \nexcess is recognised as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\t\n\u0007The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be \ninitially measured either at fair value or at the non-\ncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the fair \nvalue of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice \nof measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-\nacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying \nvalue of non-controlling interests is the amount of those \ninterests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling \ninterests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.

The estimation is made using existing \ntechnology, at current prices, and discounted using an \nappropriate discount rate where the effect of time value of \nmoney is material. Future restoration and environmental \ncosts, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and \nthe corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as \nthe obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration \nand environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant \nand equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are \ndepreciated over the life of the related asset. The effect of \ntime value of money on the restoration and environmental \ncosts liability is recognised in the consolidated statement \nof profit and loss.\n(k)\t Stripping costs\n\t\n\u0007The Group separates two different types of stripping \ncosts that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n•\t developmental stripping costs and\n•\t production stripping costs\n\t\n\u0007Developmental stripping costs which are incurred in \norder to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves \nthat will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part \nof mining assets.\n\t\n\u0007Capitalisation of developmental stripping costs ends \nwhen the commercial production of the mineral reserves \nbegins. A mine can operate several open pits that are \nregarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine \nplanning and production. In this case, stripping costs \nare accounted for separately, by reference to the ore \nextracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits \nare highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning \nand production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\t\n\u0007The determination of whether multiple pit mines are \nconsidered separate or integrated operations depends \non each mine’s specific circumstances. The following \nfactors normally point towards the stripping costs for \nthe individual pits being accounted for separately:\n•\t mining of the second and subsequent pits is \nconducted consecutively with that of the first pit, \nrather than concurrently\n•\t separate investment decisions are made to develop \neach pit, rather than a single investment decision \nbeing made at the outset\n•\t the pits are operated as separate units in terms of \nmine planning and the sequencing of overburden and \nore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n•\t expenditures for additional infrastructure to support \nthe second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n•\t the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore \nbodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\t\n\u0007The relative importance of each factor is considered by \nthe management to determine whether, the stripping \ncosts should be attributed to the individual pit or to the \ncombined output from the several pits.\n\t\n\u0007Production stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore \nin the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an \nadditional component of an ore body or deeper levels of \nmaterial. Production stripping costs are accounted for \nas inventories to the extent the benefit from production \nstripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\t\n\u0007The Group recognises a stripping activity asset in the \nproduction phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n•\t it is probable that the future economic benefit \n(improved access to the ore body) associated with the \nstripping activity will flow to the Group\n•\t the Group can identify the component of the ore body \nfor which access has been improved and\n•\t the costs relating to the improved access to that \ncomponent can be measured reliably.\n\t\n\u0007Such costs are presented within mining assets.

If that rate cannot be readily \ndetermined, the Group uses incremental borrowing \nrate. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured \nby increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest \non the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to \nreflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the \ncarrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease \nmodifications.

The \nprovision is measured at the present value of the lower \nof the expected cost of terminating the contract and \nthe expected net cost of continuing with the contract. \nBefore a provision is established, the Group recognises \nany impairment loss on the assets associated with \nthat contract.\n(s)\t Government grants\n\t\n\u0007Government grants are recognised at its fair value, where \nthere is a reasonable assurance that such grants will be \nreceived and compliance with the conditions attached \ntherewith have been met.\n\t\n\u0007Government grants related to expenditure on property, plant \nand equipment are credited to the consolidated statement \nof profit and loss over the useful lives of qualifying assets \nor other systematic basis representative of the pattern of \nfulfilment of obligations associated with the grant received. \nGrants received less amounts credited to the consolidated \nstatement of profit and loss at the reporting date are included \nin the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income.\n(t)\t\nIncome taxes\n\t\n\u0007Tax expense for the year comprises of current and \ndeferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on \ntaxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from \nnet profit as reported in the consolidated statement of \nprofit and loss because it excludes items of income or \nexpense that are taxable or deductible in other years \nand it further excludes items that are never taxable \nor deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is \ncalculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been \nenacted or substantively enacted in countries where the \nCompany and its subsidiaries operate by the end of the \nreporting period.\n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or \nrecoverable on differences between the carrying value \nof assets and liabilities in the financial statements and \nthe corresponding tax bases used in the computation \nof taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance \nsheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally \nrecognised for all taxable temporary differences. In \ncontrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the \nextent that it is probable that future taxable profits will \nbe available against which the temporary differences can \nbe utilised.\n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable \ntemporary differences arising on investments in \nsubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where \nthe Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary \ndifference and it is probable that the temporary \ndifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\t\n\u0007The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at \nthe end of each reporting period and reduced to the \nextent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable \nprofits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to \nbe recovered.\n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected \nto apply in the period when the liability is settled or the \nasset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that \nhave been enacted or substantially enacted by the end \nof the reporting period. The measurement of deferred \ntax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences \nthat would follow from the manner in which the Group \nexpects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or \nsettle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\t\n\u0007Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent \nthat they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority \nand they are in the same taxable entity, or a Group of \ntaxable entities where the tax losses of one entity are \nused to offset the taxable profits of another and there \nare legally enforceable rights to set off current tax assets \nand current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction.\n\t\n\u0007Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense \nor income in the consolidated statement of profit and \nloss, except when they relate to items credited or debited \neither in other comprehensive income or directly in \nequity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other \ncomprehensive income or directly in equity.\n2.\t Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\nF163\n"

Delivery occurs \nwhen the products have been shipped or delivered to the \nspecific location as the case may be, the risks of loss has \nbeen transferred, and either the customer has accepted \nthe products in accordance with the sales contract, or \nthe Group has objective evidence that all criteria for \nacceptance have been satisfied. Sale of products include \nrelated ancillary services, if any.\n\t\n\u0007Goods are often sold with volume and price discounts \nbased on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. \nRevenue from these sales is recognised based on the \nprice specified in the contract, net of the estimated \nvolume and price discounts. Accumulated experience is \nused to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the \nmost likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the \nextent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal \nwill not occur. A liability is recognised for expected \nvolume discounts payable to customers in relation to \nsales made until the end of the reporting period. No \nelement of financing is deemed present as the sales are \ngenerally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which \nis consistent with market practice. Any obligation to \nprovide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable \nis recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the \npoint in time that the consideration is unconditional \nbecause only the passage of time is required before the \npayment is due.\n\t\n\u0007The Group does not adjust the transaction prices for \nany time value of money in case of contracts where the \nperiod between the transfer of the promised goods or \nservices to the customer and payment by the customer \ndoes not exceed one year.\n\t\nSale of power\n\t\n\u0007Revenue from sale of power is recognised when the \nservices are provided to the customer based on approved \ntariff rates established by the respective regulatory \nauthorities. The Group doesn’t recognise revenue and an \nasset for cost incurred in the past that will be recovered.\n(v)\t Foreign currency transactions and translations\n\t\n\u0007The consolidated financial statements of the Group are \npresented in Indian Rupee (“H”), which is the functional \ncurrency of the Company and the presentation currency \nfor the consolidated financial statements.\n\t\n\u0007In preparing the consolidated financial statements, \ntransactions in currencies other than the entity’s \nfunctional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange \nprevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of \neach reporting period, monetary items denominated in \nforeign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing \nat the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items \ncarried at fair value that are denominated in foreign \ncurrencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the \ndate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary \nitems that are measured in terms of historical cost in a \nforeign currency are not translated.\n\t\n\u0007Exchange differences arising on the retranslation or \nsettlement of other monetary items are included in the \nconsolidated statement of profit and loss for the period.\n\t\n\u0007For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial \nstatements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s \nforeign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are \nexpressed in “H” using exchange rates prevailing at \nthe end of the reporting period. Income and expense \nitems are translated at the average exchange rates \nfor the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, \nare recognised in other comprehensive income and \naccumulated in a separate component of equity. On the \ndisposal of a foreign operation, all of the accumulated \nexchange differences in respect of that operation \nattributable to the Company are reclassified to the \nconsolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\t\n\u0007Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the \nacquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and \nliabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the \nclosing rate.\n(w)\t Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\t\n\u0007No new amendments to Ind AS has been notified by the \nMinistry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) during the current \nfinancial year.\n2.\t Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\nFinancial Statements\nF164\n"

Also refer note 49, page F261.\n\t\n\u0007The outcome of the Group’s goodwill impairment as at March 31, 2024 for BU Ijmuiden CGU resulted in no impairment of \ngoodwill (2022- 23: Nil). \n(ii)\t\n\u0007The carrying value of goodwill includes H1,195.69 crore (March 31, 2023: H1,195.69 crore) that arose on the acquisition of \nNeelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (“NINL”) through erstwhile Tata Steel Long Products Limited. The recoverable value of NINL \nhas been assessed at fair value less costs to sell using cash flow forecasts based on the most recently approved business \nplan for financial year 2024-25. Beyond financial year 2024-25, the cash flow forecasts is based on strategic forecasts which \ncover a period of eight years and future projections taking the analysis out to perpetuity.

The Writ Petition was decided by judgment dated August 3, 2022. By the judgment, the High Court \ndeclared that the corpus of SDF can only be utilised for the benefit of the main steel producers. However, the waiver of loan as \nsought by the Company was not allowed. Hence, against the judgment the Company filed an appeal in the High Court being \nAPO No. 85 of 2022.\n\t\n\u0007The appeal has been decided on January 3, 2023. By the final order, High Court has directed the Company to submit a fresh \nrepresentation to Union of India and fixed a time of three months for Union of India to take a decision on the representation. \nThe Company has submitted the representation on March 28, 2023. \n\t\n\u0007The representation of the Company was rejected by Government of India (Ministry of Steel) on December 29, 2023. By a letter \nof January 2024, the Company sought No-objection certificate (“NoC”) from Joint Plant Committee (“JPC”) for scheme of \namalgamation of two of its subsidiary companies, namely Bhubaneshwar Power Private Limited and Indian Steel and Wire \nProducts Limited. By its letter dated February 22, 2024, while NoC has been issued for the merger, JPC has directed the Company \nto repay the outstanding SDF loans with interest within one month. \n\t\n\u0007The Company has challenged the rejection of representation by Union of India (vide its communication dated December 29, \n2023) and the direction of JPC to the Company to repay the outstanding loans by filing a Writ Petition being WPO No. 227 of \n2024. It was also the contention of the company that the company is entitled to refund of all sums paid by it to SDF and that the \nUnion of India has no right to the same. On May 24, 2024, the Calcutta High Court (Single Bench) has dismissed the writ petition \nfiled by the Company. The Company is in the process of evaluating the future course of action. \n\t\n\u0007The loan as stated in the consolidated financial statement includes funded interest ₹1,189.92 crore (March 31, 2023: ₹1,111.84 \ncrore). \n\t\n\u0007It includes ₹1,639.33 crore (March 31, 2023: ₹1,639.33 crore) representing repayments and interest on earlier loans for which \napplications of funding are awaiting sanction and is not secured by charge on movable assets of the Company.\n(b)\t Loans from banks/financial institutions\n\t\n\u0007The borrowings in Tata Steel Europe relate to the senior facility arrangement (SFA) which was refinanced in October 2022. The \nSFA is secured against the assets and shares of Tata Steel UK Limited and the shares of Tata Steel Netherlands Holdings BV (TSNH). \nThe SFA contains a financial covenant which sets an annual maximum capital expenditure at TSNH and contains covenants for \ncash flow to debt service and debt tangible net worth calculated at the Company level.

With the exception of \ncertain unfunded arrangements, the assets of \nthese schemes are held in administered funds \nthat are legally separated from TSE. For those \npension schemes set up under a trust, the trustees \nare required by law to act in the best interests of \nthe schemes beneficiaries in accordance with the \nscheme rules and relevant pension legislation. The \ntrustees are generally responsible for the investment \npolicy with regard to the assets of the fund, after \nconsulting with the sponsoring employer. \n\t\n\t\n\u0007TSE accounts for all pension and post-retirement \ndefined benefit arrangements using Ind AS 19 \n“Employee Benefits”, with independent actuaries \nbeing used to calculate the costs, assets and \nliabilities to be recognised in relation to these \nschemes. The present value of the defined benefit \nobligation, the current service cost and past service \ncosts are calculated by these actuaries using \nthe Projected unit credit method. However, the \nongoing funding arrangements of each scheme, in \nplace to meet their long-term pension liabilities, are \ngoverned by the individual scheme documentation \nand national legislation.

      "text": "NOTES\nforming part of the consolidated financial statements\nThe current Scheme was created on March 28, \n2018 when 69% of the members of the old Scheme \ntransferred into the current Scheme. The Scheme \nis sponsored by TSUK and currently has around \n64,000 members of which 80% are pensioners \nwith benefits in payment. Although TSUK has a \nlegal obligation to fund any future deficit, a key \ncondition of the new BSPS going forward was that \nit was sufficiently well funded to meet the Scheme’s \nmodified liabilities on a self-sufficiency basis with a \nbuffer to cover residual risks.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007Since the Scheme came into existence, the BSPS \nTrustee and TSUK established a framework for \ndynamic de-risking as and when conditions were \nappropriate. The framework provided for the \nparties to agree to partial buy-in transactions \nwith one or more insurers over a period of time. \nIn relation to this, the scheme completed its first \nbuy-in transaction in respect to a small portion of \nthe overall liabilities during the year ended March \n31, 2022. It has also completed two further buy-\nin transactions during the year ended March 31, \n2023 involving the purchase of annuities with an \nexternal insurer of the order of H21,378.10 crore and \nH20,406.37 crore in May 2022 and December 2022 \nrespectively. On May 17, 2023 the BSPS completed \na final buy-in transaction with an external insurer \nwith a value of the order of H28,054.51 which \nensures that the all liabilities of the Scheme are \nnow fully insured. The funding levels secured as \npart of these arrangements will enable the Trustee \nto award a payment of 3% in order to restore an \nelement of member benefits which were foregone \nas part of the RAA. The final buy-in also included \nthe purchase of an insurance policy on an “all risks” \nbasis whereby any risks for data cleanse items \n(e.g. impact of Guaranteed Minimum Pension and \nBarber equalisation) and residual risks (e.g. whether \nany members claim that their benefit calculations \nare incorrect) were passed on to the insurer.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007On September 29, 2023 TSUK and the Scheme \nTrustee signed a Deed of Amendment that \nstipulated that the Trustee shall apply any surplus \nassets at the time of winding up of the Scheme to \naugment member benefits to the fullest extent \npossible after allowing for any expenses necessary \nto wind up the Scheme. The Deed set out both \nparties’ intentions that the winding up of the \nScheme will take place as soon as all the tasks \nnecessary to achieve this are completed. This is \nexpected to take around three years. TSUK retains \nthe sole power to decide whether to proceed to \nwind-up the Scheme and buy-out liabilities. At \nthe date the Deed was signed TSUK performed an \nexercise that estimated the expected surplus of the \nScheme at the earliest date a wind up was possible \nwas likely to be around H1,194.91 crore. As a result \nof the Deed, a past service cost equal to H1,194.91 \ncrore was recorded in the income statement in the \ncurrent year.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The Deed of Amendment means that there is no \nlonger an ability for TSUK to access any of the \nsurplus of the Scheme. In accordance with Ind AS \n19 an ‘asset ceiling’ has been applied to reflect the \nfact that TSUK no longer has an unconditional right \nto a refund from the Scheme and the net surplus \nhas been restricted to Nil on the Group’s balance \nsheet from September 29, 2023.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007The BSPS previously held an anti-embarrassment \ninterest in TSUK agreed as part of the RAA entered \ninto in 2017. The anti-embarrassment interest was \ninitially 33.33% at the time of the RAA but was \ndiluted to less than 1% due to successive equity \nissuances by TSUK to its parent company Corus \nGroup Limited. In March 2024, BSPS transferred \nits anti-embarrassment interest to TSUK’s parent \ncompany Corus Group Limited though the Scheme \nretains an economic interest in the value of those \nshares. No value has been included in the BSPS’s \nassets as at March 31, 2024 (2023: Nil) for its interest \nin TSUK.\n\t\n\t\n\u0007As at March 31, 2024 the Scheme had an Ind AS 19 \nsurplus of Nil (March 31, 2023: 6,965.10).

Some of such arrangements do not qualify \nfor de-recognition due to recourse arrangements being in \nplace. Consequently, the proceeds received from transfer \nare recorded as short-term borrowings from banks and \nfinancial institutions. As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, \n2023, there has been no such transfer of trade receivables.\n(e)\t Financial risk management\n\t\n\u0007In the course of its business, the Group is exposed \nprimarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange \nrates, commodity prices, interest rates, equity \nprices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely \nimpact the fair value of its financial instruments. \nEntities within the Group have a risk management \npolicy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks \nbut also other risks associated with the financial assets \nand liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. \nThe risk management policy is approved by the Board \nof Directors of the respective companies. The risk \nmanagement framework aims to:\n\t\n(i)\t\n\u0007create a stable business planning environment \nby reducing the impact of currency, commodity \nprices and interest rate fluctuations on the entity’s \nbusiness plan.\n\t\n(ii)\t\n\u0007achieve greater predictability to earnings by \ndetermining the financial value of the expected \nearnings in advance.\n(i)\t\nMarket risk\n\t\n\u0007Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in \nrealisable fair values or in future cash flows that may \nresult from a change in the price of a financial instrument. \nThe value of a financial instrument may change as a result \nof changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange \nrates, commodity prices, equity price fluctuations, \nliquidity and other market changes. Future specific \nmarket movements cannot be normally predicted with \nreasonable accuracy.\n(a)\t Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\t\n\u0007The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates \nmay have potential impact on the consolidated \nstatement of profit and loss and equity, where any \ntransaction references more than one currency or \nwhere assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency \nother than the functional currency of the respective \nconsolidated entities.\n\t\n\u0007Considering the countries and economic environment in \nwhich the Group operates, its operations are subject to \nrisks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those \ncountries. The risks primarily relate to fluctuations in US \nDollar, Great British Pound, Euro, Singapore Dollar, and \nThai Baht against the respective functional currencies of \nthe Company and its subsidiaries.\n\t\n\u0007Entities as per their risk management policy, use foreign \nexchange forward and other derivative instruments \nprimarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate \nexposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may \nimpact the respective entities’ cost of imports and cost \nof borrowings and consequently may increase the cost \nof financing the Group’s capital expenditures.\n\t\n\u0007A 10% appreciation/depreciation of foreign currencies \nwith respect to the functional currency of the entities \nwithin the Group would result in a decrease/increase in \nthe Group’s net profit and equity before considering tax \nimpacts by approximately H2,179.34 crore for the year \nended March 31, 2024, (2022-23: H4,502.57 crore).\n\t\n\u0007The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by \nassuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates \nshift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional \ncurrency of the entities within the Group.\n\t\n\u0007The sensitivity analysis has been based on the \ncomposition of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities \nas at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 excluding trade \npayables, trade receivables, other derivative and non-\nderivative financial instruments not forming part of \ndebt and which do not present a material exposure. The \nperiod end balances are not necessarily representative \nof the average debt outstanding during the period.\n(b)\t Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\t\n\u0007Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow \nsensitivity for changes in variable interest rates.

      "text": "NOTES\nforming part of the consolidated financial statements\n\t\n\u0007The Group is subject to variable interest rates on some \nof its interest bearing liabilities. The Group’s interest rate \nexposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\t\n\u0007Based on the composition of debt as at March 31, \n2024 and March 31, 2023 a 100 basis points increase in \ninterest rates would increase the Group’s finance costs \n(before considering interest eligible for capitalisation) \nand thereby consequently reduce net profit and equity \nbefore considering tax impacts by approximately \nH425.09 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024  \n(2022-23: H340.60 crore).\n\t\n\u0007The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of \n100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves.

Across the Group, forward purchases are \nalso made of zinc, tin and nickel to cover sales contracts \nwith fixed metal prices.\n\t\n\u0007There was no significant market risk relating to the \nconsolidated statement of profit and loss since the \nmajority of commodity derivatives are treated as cash flow \nhedges with movements being reflected in equity and the \ntiming and recognition in the consolidated statement of \nprofit and loss would depend on the point at which the \nunderlying hedged transactions are recognised.\n(iii)\t Credit risk\n\t\n\u0007Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counter-\nparty failure to repay or service debt according to the \ncontractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses \nboth the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration \nof credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\t\n\u0007Entities within the Group have a policy of dealing \nonly with credit worthy counter parties and obtaining \nsufficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of \nmitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.\n\t\n\u0007Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk \nand concentration thereof principally consist of trade \nreceivables, loans receivables, investments in debt \nsecurities and mutual funds, balances with banks, bank \ndeposits, derivatives and financial guarantees provided \nby the Group. None of the financial instruments of the \nGroup result in material concentration of credit risk.\n\t\n\u0007The carrying value of financial assets represents the \nmaximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit \nrisk was H16,419.15 crore and H24,760.25 crore as at March \n31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, being the total \ncarrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, \nbank deposits, investments in debt securities and mutual \nfunds, loans, derivative assets and other financial assets \nnet of insurance cover, wherever applicable.\n\t\n\u0007The risk relating to trade receivables is presented in  \nnote 15, page F191.\n\t\n\u0007The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and \nthere is no concentration of credit risk with respect \nto any particular customer as at March 31, 2024 and  \nMarch 31, 2023.\n\t\n\u0007In respect of financial guarantees provided by the \nGroup to banks and financial institutions, the maximum \nexposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum \namount which the Group would have to pay if the \nguarantee is called upon.

The cashflow projections include the impact \nof decarbonisation given that both the UK and Tata Steel Netherlands (TSN) businesses within TSE have stated their plans \nto move away from the current production process and to transition to electric arc based production. Decarbonisation as \na whole is likely to provide significant opportunities to TSE as it is likely to increase the demand for steel as it is crucial as \nan infrastructure enabler for all technological transition within the wider economy ( e.g. wind power, hydrogen, electric \nvehicles, nuclear plants etc.) and compares favourably to other materials when considering the life cycle emissions of the \nmaterial. The technology transition and investments are dependent on national and international policies and would also \nbe driven by the government decisions in the country of operation. Management’s assessment is that generally, these \npotential carbon reduction-related costs would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through \npublic spending/subsidies.\n\t\n\u0007On September 15, 2023, Tata Steel UK Limited (“TSUK”) which forms the main part of the UK Business, announced a joint \nagreement with the UK Government on a proposal to invest in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace (‘EAF’) steelmaking at \nthe Port Talbot site with a capital cost of £1.25 billion inclusive of a grant from the UK Government of up to £500 million, \nsubject to relevant regulatory approvals, information and consultation processes, and the finalisation of detailed terms \nand conditions. The proposal also includes a wider restructuring of other locations and functions across TSUK.\n\t\n\u0007Consequent to the announcement, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company had assessed and \nconcluded that it had created a valid expectation to those affected and a constructive obligation existed. Accordingly, \non a prudent basis, the Company had recorded a provision of H2,425 crore towards such restructuring and closure costs \n(including redundancy and employee termination costs) and H2,631 crore towards impairment of Heavy End assets which \nwere not expected to be used for any significant period beyond March 31, 2024, in the consolidated statement of profit \nand loss.\n\t\n\u0007As per local regulations in the UK, the National Consultation between TSUK and the UK multi trade union representative \nbody (UK Steel Committee) on the asset closure plan has now been concluded. Under the proposed re-structuring \nprogramme, Port Talbot’s two blast furnaces (No.5 and No.4) would get closed by end of June 2024 and latest by the end \nof September 2024 respectively. Following the closure of Blast Furnace No. 4, the remaining heavy end assets would wind \ndown and the Continuous Annealing Processing Line (CAPL) would close in March 2025. TSUK has also agreed that it would \ncontinue to operate the hot strip mill through the proposed transition period and in future.\n\t\n\u0007Given the risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with the underlying market and business conditions including \nhigher inflation, higher interest rates and supply chain disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, the uncommitted nature \nof available financing options and pending the finalisation of funding support from the UK Government for the proposed \nEAF investment, there exists a material uncertainty surrounding the impact of such adversities on the financial situation \nof TSUK.\n\t\n\u0007With respect to Tata Steel Netherland operations (TSN) which forms main part of the Mainland Europe (MLE) business, \ndiscussions with the government on the proposed decarbonisation roadmap have been initiated. The transition plan \nconsiders that the policy environment in the Netherlands and EU is supportive to the European steel industry and a level \nplaying field would be achieved by, either one or a combination of: a) Dutch Policy developments, b) Convergence with EU \non (fiscal) climate measures, enabling EU steel players to pass on costs and c) tailor made support mechanisms.

The Group has assessed its ability to meet any liquidity requirements at TSE, if required, \nand concluded that its cashflow and liquidity position remains adequate.\n\t\n\u0007Within the European Operations, wherever impairment triggers existed, the recoverable amount of the CGUs have been \nassessed based on fair value less costs of disposal, which inter-alia considers impact of switching the heavy end and \nother relevant assets to a more “Green Steel” capex base. The fair value computation uses cash flow forecasts based on \nmost recent financial budgets, strategic forecasts and future projections taking the analysis out into perpetuity based \non a steady state, sustainable cash flow reflecting average steel industry conditions between successive peaks and \ntroughs of profitability. Key assumptions for the FVLCTS model relate to expected changes to selling prices and raw \nmaterial & conversion costs, EU steel demand, energy costs, exchange rates, the amount of capital expenditure needed for \ndecarbonisation, changes to EBITDA resulting from producing and selling steel with low embedded CO2 emissions, levels \nof government support for decarbonisation, phasing of decommissioning of legacy assets as well as the commissioning of \nnew low CO2 production facilities, tariff regimes and discount rates. The projections are based on both past performance \nand the expectations of future performance and assumptions therein. The Group estimates discount rates using post-tax \nrates that reflect the current market rates adjusted to reflect the way the European Union steel market would assess the \nspecific risk. The weighted average post-tax discount rates used for discounting the cash flows projections is in the range \nof 8.20% - 9.11% (March 31, 2023: 7.90% to 8.80%). Beyond the specifically forecasted period, a growth rate in the range \nof Nil - 2.00% (March 31, 2023: 1.70% - 2.00%) is used to extrapolate the cash flow projections. This rate does not exceed \nthe average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.\n\t\n\u0007The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of the carrying value in respect of Group’s CGUs and \nproperty, plant and equipment including sensitivity in respect of discount rates. If any of the key assumptions change, there \nis a risk that the headroom in the model would reduce and that the reduction in the headroom could lead to impairments of \ncarrying amount of property, plant and equipment. However, the Group believes that key assumptions represent the most \nlikely impact from decarbonisation at this point in time. Going forward, the key assumptions would be kept under review for \nchanges, if any, based on the progress of the discussions with the government and regulators on the decarbonisation plan. \n50.\t \u0007Consequent to the whistle-blower complaint in the Company’s Graphene Business Division, the Company has carried out \na detailed assessment and review of the matter and made the accounting adjustments/provisions, as appropriate, in the \nbooks of account, which were not material to the financial statements. Based on the assessment(s) and review, it has been \nconcluded that there has not been any fraud under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013. A report under sub-section \n(12) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 has been filed by the statutory auditors in Form ADT-4 as prescribed under \nRule 13 of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 with the Central Government.\n117th Year Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24\nFinancial Statements\nF262\n"
